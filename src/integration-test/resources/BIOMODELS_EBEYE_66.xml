  Abstract:
  
    We present a two-compartment model to explain the
    oscillatory behavior observed experimentally in activated
    neutrophils. Our model is based mainly on the
    peroxidase-oxidase reaction catalyzed by myeloperoxidase with
    melatonin as a cofactor and NADPH oxidase, a major protein in
    the phagosome membrane of the leukocyte. The model predicts
    that after activation of a neutrophil, an increase in the
    activity of the hexose monophosphate shunt and the delivery of
    myeloperoxidase into the phagosome results in oscillations in
    oxygen and NAD(P)H concentration. The period of oscillation
    changes from &gt;200 s to 10-30 s. The model is consistent with
    previously reported oscillations in cell metabolism and oxidant
    production. Key features and predictions of the model were
    confirmed experimentally. The requirement of the hexose
    monophosphate pathway for 10 s oscillations was verified using
    6-aminonicotinamide and dexamethasone, which are inhibitors of
    glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The role of the NADPH
    oxidase in promoting oscillations was confirmed by
    dose-response studies of the effect of diphenylene iodonium, an
    inhibitor of the NADPH oxidase. Moreover, the model predicted
    an increase in the amplitude of NADPH oscillations in the
    presence of melatonin, which was confirmed experimentally.
    Successful computer modeling of complex chemical dynamics
    within cells and their chemical perturbation will enhance our
    ability to identify new antiinflammatory compounds.

        The model reproduces the time profiles of Calcium in the spine and dendrites as depicted in Fig 8 and Fig 9 of the paper for CF activation.
            The model was reproduced using MathSBML.
            Please note that the units of volume species is molecules/micrometer cubed as against the units of microMolar given in the paper. To convert the units to microMolar multiply the species concentration by the conversion factor 1/602.

                            Modeling and simulation of the calcium signaling events that precede long-term depression of synaptic activity in cerebellar Purkinje cells are performed using the Virtual Cell biological modeling framework. It is found that the unusually high density and low sensitivity of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) are critical to the ability of the cell to generate and localize a calcium spike in a single dendritic spine. The results also demonstrate the model's capability to simulate the supralinear calcium spike observed experimentally during coincident activation of the parallel and climbing fibers. The sensitivity of the calcium spikes to certain biological and geometrical effects is investigated as well as the mechanisms that underlie the cell's ability to generate the supralinear spike. The sensitivity of calcium release rates from the IP3R to calcium concentrations, as well as IP3 concentrations, allows the calcium spike to form. The diffusion barrier caused by the small radius of the spine neck is shown to be important, as a threshold radius is observed above which a spike cannot be formed. Additionally, the calcium buffer capacity and diffusion rates from the spine are found to be important parameters in shaping the calcium spike.. null, 89.
