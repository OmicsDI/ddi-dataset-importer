        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Conditions for the hydroponic culture were adapted from Schlesier et al. (2003) with slight modifications. Approximately 50-100 wild type Arabidopsis thaliana seeds (ecotype Columbia) were surface-sterilized in 70% ethanol for 2 min followed by 15 min incubation in 5% bleach/0.1% Tween 20, inverting 5 times every 5 minutes. Seeds were then washed five times with sterilized water, and were carefully dispensed on a stainless steel wire mesh platform (mesh size 1 mm; 4 cm x 4 cmm x 2 cm) layered previously with 1% sterilized agarose in a round plastic vessel (diameter 68 mm, height 76 mm) containing approximately 60 ml liquid media (¼-strength Murashige &amp; Skoog medium without vitamins, ¼-strength Gamborg B5 vitamins solution, 2mM MES, 0.5% [w/v] sucrose, pH 5.8). Arabidopsis plants were grown under 16/8 hr light/dark period with light intensity 100-125 umolm-2s-1 at 20oC over three weeks. Liquid medium was regularly replaced with freshly made liquid medium every seven days.
 Hybridization - Affymetrix Generic Hybridization
 Labeling - The mRNA in 5 &amp;#956;g of total cellular RNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA using Superscript II with a T7-(dT) primer using One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix). The cDNA was in vitro transcribed to complementary RNA (cRNA) by incorporating biotin-UTP using the GeneChip IVT Labeling Kit (Affymetrix)
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy plant mini protocol and RNase free DNase kit (QIAGEN, Clifton Hill, Victoria, Australia). The quality of isolated RNA was assessed by spectrophotometric analysis of A260/A280 ratio using ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmingon, DE, USA) and qualitative analysis using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA).

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Seeds were germinated on Petri dishes with solid growth medium. After stratification for 2-4 days, plates were transferred to a I-36VL Percival growth chamber (continuous white light, 22C; 60% humidity) for 7 days. 
 Hybridization - For each hybridization 250 pmol of Cy3 and Cy5 probes were mixed, dried in speed-vac, and resuspended in 9 ul of RNase-free water. Labelled aRNA was fragmented by adding 1 ul of 10x Fragmentation buffer (Ambion) and incubating at 70°C for 15 minutes. The reaction was stopped with 1 ul of Stop solution (Ambion). Integrity and average size of aRNA and fragmented aRNA were evaluated using the Bioanalyzer 2100. The final volume of the probe was diluted to 100 ul in hibridization solution. Printed slides were rehydrated over a 65°C water bath for 10 seconds and dried on a 65°C heating block for 10 seconds. This hydration step was repeated three times. Oligonucleotides were fixed by UV radiation of 120mJ. Slides were washed in 1% SDS for 5 minutes, H2O for 5 minutes and in absolute ethanol for 30 seconds. Finally, slides were dried by centrifugation at 141g for 3 minutes. Prehybridization was performed at 42°C for 30-45 minutes in 6x SSC, 0.5% SDS and 1% BSA. Slides were rinsed five times with distilled water. Cy5 and Cy3 amplified RNA (aRNA) fragmented probes were mixed (250 pmol of each label) with 20 ug of PolyA (Sigma) and 20 ug of yeast tRNA (Sigma) in a final volume of 100 ul of hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 6x SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5x Denhardt's). The probe was denatured at 95°C for 5 minutes and applied to the slide using a LifterSlip (Erie Scientific). Slides were then incubated at 37°C for 16h in hybridization chambers (Array-It). After incubation, slides were washed twice with 0.5x SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 minutes each, twice with 0.5x SSC for 5 minutes and finally in 0.05x SSC for 5 minutes. Slides were dried by centrifugation at 563g for 1 minute.
 Labeling - This protocol was performed by the Genomics Facility at Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia, CSIC (Madrid, SPAIN). &lt;br>&lt;br> 7.5 ug of aminoallyl-labeled amplified RNA were resuspended in 0.1 M Na2CO3 (pH 9.0) and labeled with Cy3 Mono NHS Ester (CyTMDye Post-labeling Reactive Dye Pack, Amersham). Samples were purified following the manufacturer's instructions for Megaclear TM (Ambion) and Cy3 incorporation was measured using 1 ul of the probe in the Nanodrop spectrophotometer.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Each RNA sample comes from seedlings of Arabidopsis collected from two independent plates. The frozen plant tissue (~100 mg) was ground in tiny mortars dipped in liquid nitrogen. The frozen powder was transferred into 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes using spatulas cooled with liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat. No. 74904) according to manufacturer's instructions. 1 ug of total RNA was amplified via the aRNA MessageAmp II kit (Ambion, 1751), by the Genomics Facility at Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia, CSIC (Madrid, SPAIN)</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - This protocol was performed by the Genomics Facility at Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia, CSIC (Madrid, SPAIN).&lt;br>&lt;br> Background correction and normalization of expression data were performed using LIMMA.LIMMA is part of Bioconductor, an R language project. First, the data set was filtered based on the spot quality. A strategy of adaptive background correction was used that avoids exaggerated variability of log-ratios for low-intensity spots. For local background correction the "normexp" method in LIMMA to adjust the local median background was used. The resulting log-ratios were print-tip loess normalized for each array. To have similar distribution across arrays and to achieve consistency among arrays, log-ratio values were scaled using as scale estimator the median-absolute-value. &lt;br>&lt;br> Linear model methods were used for determining differentially expressed genes. Each probe was tested for changes in expression over replicates by using an empirical Bayes moderated t statistic. To control the false discovery rate p-values were corrected by using the method of Benjamani and Hochberg. The expected false discovery rate was controlled to be less than 5%.

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Sterile seeds were vernalized for 3 days at 4ºC, and were grown on Johnson's media plates containing 0.7% w/v agar. 
 Sample Processing - After ten days the seedlings were frozen under liquid nitrogen (Col-0 and 35S:AtMYC2)
 Hybridization - For each hybridization 250 pmol of Cy3 and Cy5 probes were mixed, dried in speed-vac, and resuspended in 9 ul of RNase-free water. Labelled aRNA was fragmented by adding 1 ul of 10x Fragmentation buffer (Ambion) and incubating at 70ºC for 15 minutes. The reaction was stopped with 1 ul of Stop solution (Ambion). Integrity and average size of aRNA and fragmented aRNA were evaluated using the Bioanalyzer 2100. The final volume of the probe was diluted to 100 ul in hibridization solution. Printed slides were rehydrated over a 65ºC water bath for 10 seconds and dried on a 65ºC heating block for 10 seconds. This hydration step was repeated three times. Oligonucleotides were fixed by UV radiation of 120mJ. Slides were washed in 1% SDS for 5 minutes, H2O for 5 minutes and in absolute ethanol for 30 seconds. Finally, slides were dried by centrifugation at 141g for 3 minutes. Prehybridization was performed at 42ºC for 30-45 minutes in 6x SSC, 0.5% SDS and 1% BSA. Slides were rinsed five times with distilled water. Cy5 and Cy3 amplified RNA (aRNA) fragmented probes were mixed (250 pmol of each label) with 20 ug of PolyA (Sigma) and 20 ug of yeast tRNA (Sigma) in a final volume of 100 ul of hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 6x SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5x Denhardt's). The probe was denatured at 95ºC for 5 minutes and applied to the slide using a LifterSlip (Erie Scientific). Slides were then incubated at 37ºC for 16h in hybridization chambers (Array-It). After incubation, slides were washed twice with 0.5x SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 minutes each, twice with 0.5x SSC for 5 minutes and finally in 0.05x SSC for 5 minutes. Slides were dried by centrifugation at 563g for 1 minute.
 Labeling - 7.5 ug of aminoallyl-labeled aRNA were resuspended in 0.1 M Na2CO3 (pH 9.0) and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 Mono NHS Ester (CyTMDye Post-labeling Reactive Dye Pack, Amersham). Samples were purified following the manufacturer's instructions for Megaclear TM (Ambion) and Cy3 or Cy5 incorporation was measured using 1 ul of the probe in the Nanodrop spectrophotometer
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - The frozen plant tissue (~100 mg) was ground in tiny mortars dipped in liquid nitrogen. The frozen powder was carefully transfered into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes using small funnels and rubber spatulas also cooled with liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, 15596-026)according to manufacturer's instructions and purified with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, 74104).1 ug of total RNA was amplified via the aRNA MessageAmp II kit (Ambion, 1751)</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - Linear model methods were used for determining differentially expressed genes. Each probe was tested for changes in expression over replicates by using an empirical Bayes moderated t statistic. To control the false discovery rate p-values were corrected by using the method of Benjamani and Hochberg. The expected false discovery rate was controlled to be less than 5%.
 Image Adquisition - Images from Cy3 and Cy5 channels were equilibrated and captured with a GenePix 4000B (Axon) and spots were converted into numerical data using GenPix software (Axon).</field>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Hybridization - Hybridisation and Staining Protocols &lt;br/> These are the protocols used by the Microarray Centre to process labelled cRNA for GeneChip experiments, There are several protocols which can be used and their use is determined by the state of the cRNA and the type of chip being used. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>  1.Hybridisation of fragmented cRNA to GeneChip &lt;br/>  2.Preparation of GeneChip Station &lt;br/>  3.Either: a. Test 3 Processing b. Genome scale array processing &lt;br/>  4.Shutdown of GeneChip Station &lt;br/> &lt;br/> A. Hybridisation of fragmented cRNA to GeneChip &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1. There are two septa on the back of the GeneChip. Whilst filling or emptying the hybridisation chamber through one septum, a pipette tip must be inserted into the other as a vent. &lt;br/> 2. The more you inset/remove tips into the septa, the looser they will become. Eventually they will start to leak. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Equilibrate array at room temperature for 30 minutes before use. &lt;br/> 2. Heat frozen fragmented cRNA at 99oC for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 3. During incubation, pre-wet the array by filling with 200µl (100µl for test or mini arrays) of 1x hybridisation Buffer. Incubate in rotisserie oven at 45oC, 60rpm for 10 minutes. &lt;br/> 4. Cool fragmented cRNA at 45oC for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 5. To bring any particulate matter to the bottom of the tube, spin fragmented cRNA at maximum speed (ý13,000g) for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 6. Remove buffer solution from array, ensuring that all solution is removed. &lt;br/> 7. Add 200µl (100µl for test or mini array) of fragmented cRNA avoiding any debris at the bottom of the tube. &lt;br/> 8. Hybridise in rotisserie oven at 45oC, 60rpm, for 16 hours (overnight). &lt;br/> 9. Store remaining volume of fragmented cRNA at 20oC. &lt;br/> 10. After hybridization, proceed to Preparation of GeneChip station. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> B. Preparation of GeneChip station &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note:&lt;br/>  1. Scanner must be switched on before launching Microarray Suite. When the scanner is switched on, yellow and green lights should illuminate. If there is a problem the red light will come on, or the yellow and green lights will flash. When the scanner is warmed the yellow light is extinguished. &lt;br/> 2. When entering experiment info in step (4), complete experiment name, array type, array lot, operator name, and sample type (cRNA). If known fill in sample description and insert Target ID in sample project. &lt;br/> 3. If a fluidics station has already been used and wash solutions have not been changed, steps (7-9) will not be necessary. &lt;br/> 4. In step (7) take care not to touch the hoses. &lt;br/> 5. In step (8) prime all ports of a fluidics station even if they are not all required. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Switch on scanner. &lt;br/> 2. Login to computer. &lt;br/> 3. Launch Microarray Suite from desktop icon. &lt;br/> 4. From Tools menu select Defaults and then File Locations to check the location in which the files will be saved. &lt;br/> 5.

 Labeling - cRNA preparation using phenol &lt;br/> These protocols are based on those provided by Affymetrix and include modifications from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, MIT, Boston and the CSC/IC Microarray Centre. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> A. First strand cDNA synthesis 5.11.01 &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> &lt;br/> 1.It is very important to start with good quality, clean, total RNA. Acceptable ratios for the absorbance of the total RNA at 260nm and 280nm are between 1.9 and 2.1. Ensure that the total RNA is diluted, so that the absorbances measured are in the linear range for the spectrophotometer. This is often between 0.1 and 0.4 absorbance units. &lt;br/> 2.For step (1) we recommend starting with 10µg total RNA per reaction tube. Do not start with less than 10µg total RNA per reaction. Carry out two reactions for each sample if you require more than 40µg of cRNA. &lt;br/> 3.Steps (3) and (4) are key to the preparation of cDNA. Step (3) breaks any secondary structures of the RNA while step (4) inhibits the reoccurrence of secondary structures. &lt;br/> 4.Make a 'master mix' for step (5). Mix thoroughly and spin briefly, as necessary. &lt;br/> 5.Use RNase free microfuge tubes and pipette tips throughout.&lt;br/>  &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Place the following in a microfuge tube: &lt;br/>  -µl (10µg) total RNA in nuclease free treated dH2O &lt;br/>  -µl (100 pmol) T7-(T)24 primer &lt;br/>  (GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(T)24) &lt;br/>  1µl Poly A+ Controls &lt;br/>  -µl nuclease free dH2O &lt;br/>  11 µl final volume &lt;br/> 2.Mix by pipetting, spin briefly as necessary. &lt;br/> 3.Incubate at 65-70oC for 10 minutes. &lt;br/> 4.Place tubes on ice. &lt;br/> 5.Prepare a master mix on ice. The quantities are for each reaction/tube: &lt;br/>  4µl (5x) First Strand Buffer (thaw at 37oC, put on ice), Invitrogen Y02321 &lt;br/>  2µl (0.1 M) DTT, Invitrogen Y00147 &lt;br/>  1µl (10mM) dNTPs, Invitrogen 18427-013 &lt;br/>  7µl &lt;br/>  Mix by pipetting, spin briefly as necessary.Add 7µl of master mix to each reaction tube.&lt;br/>  6.Incubate at 42 oC for 2 minutes. &lt;br/> 7.Add 2µl Superscript II reverse transcriptase (400 U total), Invitrogen 18064-014. &lt;br/> 8.Tap tube to mix, spin briefly as necessary. &lt;br/> 9.Incubate at 42oC for 1 hour in a waterbath. &lt;br/> 10.Place tube on ice and proceed to 'Second strand cDNA synthesis', or transfer tube to dry ice, allow reaction to freeze and store at -80oC. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> B. Second strand cDNA synthesis 12.02.01. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1.Check the units/µl for the RNase H, it is important that exactly 2U are used per reaction; you may have to adjust volumes accordingly. &lt;br/> 2.Make a 'master mix' for step (2). Mix thoroughly because the enzymes are in glycerol. Spin briefly, as necessary. &lt;br/> 3.For step (4), incubate either in a water bath in the cold room or in a refrigerated block with a lid, to reduce condensation. &lt;br/> 4.For step (5), store at -80oC only if you cannot go to the 'Clean-up of double stranded cDNA' step immediately after the second strand cDNA synthesis is completed. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1.Place all reagents and first strand reaction tubes on ice.

Clean-up of cRNA 07.03.03. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1.Removal of unincorporated biotinylated ribonucleotides is very important &lt;br/> obtaining a good quality scan.&lt;br/> 2. cRNA clean up is carried out using the GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module,Affymetrix 900371. Prepare reagents following the instructions in the kit.&lt;br/> 3. Ensure ethanol has been added to IVT cRNA Wash Buffer before use. &lt;br/> 4. Be careful not to touch the tip of the spin column at any time. &lt;br/> 5. Carry out centrifugation at >= 8,000g (>= 10,000rpm). &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method: &lt;br/>  1.Add to the in vitro transcription reaction tubes: &lt;br/>  60µl nuclease free dH2O &lt;br/>  350µl IVT cRNA Binding Buffer &lt;br/> 2.Mix thoroughly by pipetting. &lt;br/> 3.Add 250µl (100%) ethanol.

The dilution should be sufficient so that readings obtained are in the linear range for the spectrophotometer. Unless known otherwise assume this is between 0.1 and 0.4 absorbance units (try preparing a serial dilution, diluting 2µl of eluate in 48µl of dH2O and then this 50µl in 450µl of dH2O). The cRNA should be clean e.g. a ratio of the absorbances at 260nm to 280nm should be around 2.0, with an acceptable range of 1.9 to 2.1. You should have 40 to 110µg of cRNA (assuming that you started with 10µg total RNA where 1 OD260 unit is equivalent to 40µg/ml single stranded RNA). If you have a yield of less than 40µg of cRNA per reaction (per 10µg reaction of total RNA), we recommend that you do not use the cRNA, as there is likely to be a problem with sample preparation. &lt;br/> 22.Run a sample of the total RNA and cRNA for each sample (500ng to 1µg) on a denaturing 1% agarose gel along with a marker spanning 200bp to 3kb (a DNA marker gives a rough idea of the size). The cRNA product should be a smear from about 100bp to 2kb with a brighter region from 500bp to 1kb, there is an example image for guidance at the end of this protocol. Photograph the gel, so that the markers are easy to identify and label the lanes with the sample identifier. &lt;br/> 23.Freeze by placing tube on dry ice and store at 80 °C. &lt;br/> 24.Bring the cRNA to the Microarray Centre on dry ice (after prior consultation with Helen Banks or Nicola Cooley to arrange a convenient time). Note that each sample should be clearly labelled on both the top and side of each tube with the date (day, month, year e.g. 05.11.01) and the sample identifier. &lt;br/> In order to assess the quality of the cRNA samples, prior to hybridisation on test arrays, we also require the following information, for both the cRNA samples and the total RNA from which it was generated. &lt;br/>   (a) the raw absorbance readings &lt;br/>   (b) the ratio of the absorbances at 260nm and 280nm. &lt;br/>   (c) the cRNA yield from 10µg of total RNA. &lt;br/>   (d) an original photograph of the gel, with the markers and samples labelled.&lt;br/>  
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - TOTAL RNA EXTRACTION FROM TISSUES &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Homogenize tissue samples in mortar with excess amount of liquid nitrogen. Measure the weight of homogenized samples.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Transfer 50-100 mg of tissues in 50ml tube having 3 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Homogenize the samples using Tekmars TISSUMIZER or Polytron or equivalent. Always keep the tube in ice so as to prevent the overheating.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Optional Step: Additional step may be required for samples with high content of proteins, fat, polysaccharides or extra cellular materials such as muscles, fat tissue and tuberous parts of the plants. Following homogenisation, remove insoluble materials by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 minutes at 2-4 .C. The resulting pellet contains insoluble materials and the supernatant contains RNA. In samples from fat tissue, an excess of fat collects as a top layer, which should be removed. Transfer the clear homogenate solution in a fresh tube.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Phase Separation: Incubate the sample at 15 to 30 .C (RT) for 5 minutes to permit for the complete dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes. Add 0.2 ml of chloroform (high grade) per 1 ml of TRIzol reagent.  Shake tubes vigorously for 15 seconds and incubate them at 15 to 30 .C (RT) for 2 to 3 minutes. Centrifuge the samples at 12000 g for 15 mints at 2 to 4.C. Following centrifugation; the mixture separates into a lower red, phenol-chloroform phase, an interphase, and a colourless upper aqueous phase. RNA remains exclusively in the aqueous phase. The volume of the aqueous phase is about 60% of the volume of TRIzol used for homogenisation.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> RNA Precipitation: Transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh tube and save the organic phase if isolation of DNA or protein is desired. Precipitate RNA from the aqueous phase by mixing with isopropyl alcohol. Use 0.5 ml of Isopropyl alcohol for every 1ml of TRIzol used. Incubate samples at 15 to 30 .C for 10 minutes and centrifuge at 12000g for 10 minutes at 2-4.C.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Remove the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet. Wash the RNA pellet once with 75% alcohol, adding at least 1ml of 75% ethanol for every 1 ml of TRIzol used. Mix the sample by vortexing slowly and centrifuge at 7500 g for 5 minutes at 2-4.C. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Remove the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet. Dry the RNA pellet in air for 10 minutes. Dissolve the RNA pellet in 100 ul of RNase free water. Pipette out few times and transfer in eppendorf tube and store in 70.C. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>                Total RNA is further cleaned up by using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) Cat No:74104 &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Step 1: 350ul of RLT buffer is required for each total RNA sample. Take the aliquot required in a tube (If you are going to clean 10 samples, calculate for 12 samples and take 12*350= 4.2 ml) and add 10ul of B-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Molecular Biology Grade) per 1ml of RLT buffer (42ul for 4.2 ml of RLT buffer).&lt;br/> Step 2: Add 350 of RLT Buffer (B-Mercaptoethanol added) to 100ul of total RNA sample (if the volume is less make up to 100ul) and mix thoroughly. Add 250ul of 100% ethanol. Mix well by pipetting. Do not centrifuge.&lt;br/> Step 3: Apply sample (Should be around 700ul) to an RNeasy mini spin column, sitting in a collection tube. Centrifuge in cold for 20 sec at 8000g. You can apply the flow through in the column for twice to improve the yield. Discard the flow through as well the tube after repeating step 3 twice. Keep the column in a fresh 2ml tube.&lt;br/> Step 4: Apply 500ul of RPE buffer (please make sure that alcohol is added in RPE buffer) on to the column. Centrifuge for 15 sec at 8000g. Discard the flow through.&lt;br/> Step 5: Apply 500ul of RPE buffer and centrifuge for 2 min at max speed. Discard the flow through. Spin again at max speed for a minute. Transfer the column in a fresh RNase free collection tube. &lt;br/> Step 6: Pipette 30ul of RNase free water on to the column. Heat the sample at 55.C for not more than 2 minutes (to get maximum yield). Centrifuge at 8000g for a minute. Repeat step 6 once more  to get 60ul of clean total RNA and proceed with QC and OD measurements. It is always to better keep the stock in two-three aliquots (to avoid freeze-thaw cycle) before freezing them in dry ice and transfer them to -80.&lt;br/> &lt;br/></field>

Hybridisation of fragmented cRNA to GeneChip &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1. There are two septa on the back of the GeneChip. Whilst filling or emptying the hybridisation chamber through one septum, a pipette tip must be inserted into the other as a vent. &lt;br/> 2. The more you inset/remove tips into the septa, the looser they will become. Eventually they will start to leak. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Equilibrate array at room temperature for 30 minutes before use. &lt;br/> 2. Heat frozen fragmented cRNA at 99oC for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 3. During incubation, pre-wet the array by filling with 200µl (100µl for test or mini arrays) of 1x hybridisation Buffer. Incubate in rotisserie oven at 45oC, 60rpm for 10 minutes. &lt;br/> 4. Cool fragmented cRNA at 45oC for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 5. To bring any particulate matter to the bottom of the tube, spin fragmented cRNA at maximum speed (ý13,000g) for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 6. Remove buffer solution from array, ensuring that all solution is removed. &lt;br/> 7.

 Labeling - cRNA preparation using phenol &lt;br/> These protocols are based on those provided by Affymetrix and include modifications from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, MIT, Boston and the CSC/IC Microarray Centre. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> A. First strand cDNA synthesis 5.11.01 &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> &lt;br/> 1.It is very important to start with good quality, clean, total RNA. Acceptable ratios for the absorbance of the total RNA at 260nm and 280nm are between 1.9 and 2.1. Ensure that the total RNA is diluted, so that the absorbances measured are in the linear range for the spectrophotometer. This is often between 0.1 and 0.4 absorbance units. &lt;br/> 2.For step (1) we recommend starting with 10µg total RNA per reaction tube. Do not start with less than 10µg total RNA per reaction. Carry out two reactions for each sample if you require more than 40µg of cRNA. &lt;br/> 3.Steps (3) and (4) are key to the preparation of cDNA. Step (3) breaks any secondary structures of the RNA while step (4) inhibits the reoccurrence of secondary structures. &lt;br/> 4.Make a 'master mix' for step (5). Mix thoroughly and spin briefly, as necessary. &lt;br/> 5.Use RNase free microfuge tubes and pipette tips throughout.&lt;br/>  &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Place the following in a microfuge tube: &lt;br/>  -µl (10µg) total RNA in nuclease free treated dH2O &lt;br/>  -µl (100 pmol) T7-(T)24 primer &lt;br/>  (GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(T)24) &lt;br/>  1µl Poly A+ Controls &lt;br/>  -µl nuclease free dH2O &lt;br/>  11 µl final volume &lt;br/> 2.Mix by pipetting, spin briefly as necessary. &lt;br/> 3.Incubate at 65-70oC for 10 minutes. &lt;br/> 4.Place tubes on ice. &lt;br/> 5.Prepare a master mix on ice. The quantities are for each reaction/tube: &lt;br/>  4µl (5x) First Strand Buffer (thaw at 37oC, put on ice), Invitrogen Y02321 &lt;br/>  2µl (0.1 M) DTT, Invitrogen Y00147 &lt;br/>  1µl (10mM) dNTPs, Invitrogen 18427-013 &lt;br/>  7µl &lt;br/>  Mix by pipetting, spin briefly as necessary.Add 7µl of master mix to each reaction tube.&lt;br/>  6.Incubate at 42 oC for 2 minutes. &lt;br/> 7.Add 2µl Superscript II reverse transcriptase (400 U total), Invitrogen 18064-014. &lt;br/> 8.Tap tube to mix, spin briefly as necessary. &lt;br/> 9.Incubate at 42oC for 1 hour in a waterbath. &lt;br/> 10.Place tube on ice and proceed to 'Second strand cDNA synthesis', or transfer tube to dry ice, allow reaction to freeze and store at -80oC. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> B. Second strand cDNA synthesis 12.02.01. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1.Check the units/µl for the RNase H, it is important that exactly 2U are used per reaction; you may have to adjust volumes accordingly. &lt;br/> 2.Make a 'master mix' for step (2). Mix thoroughly because the enzymes are in glycerol. Spin briefly, as necessary. &lt;br/> 3.For step (4), incubate either in a water bath in the cold room or in a refrigerated block with a lid, to reduce condensation. &lt;br/> 4.For step (5), store at -80oC only if you cannot go to the 'Clean-up of double stranded cDNA' step immediately after the second strand cDNA synthesis is completed. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1.Place all reagents and first strand reaction tubes on ice. Assemble master mix on ice. &lt;br/> 2.Prepare a master mix in a new microfuge tube. For each reaction use: &lt;br/>  -µl nuclease free treated dH2O &lt;br/>  30µl (5x) Second Strand Buffer, Invitrogen 10812-014&lt;br/>  3µl (10mM) dNTPs, Invitrogen 18427-013 &lt;br/>  1µl DNA Ligase (10 Units), Invitrogen 18052-019 &lt;br/>  4µl DNA Pol I (40 Units), Invitrogen 18010-025 &lt;br/>  -µl RNase H (2 Units), Invitrogen 18021-071 &lt;br/>  130µl &lt;br/>  Mix by vortexing, spin briefly as necessary. Add 130µl of the master mix to each of the first strand reaction tubes. &lt;br/> 3.Mix by pipetting, spin briefly as necessary.&lt;br/> 4.Incubate at 16oC for 2 hours. Use a water bath in a cold room or a refrigerated block with lid, if possible. This reduces condensation. &lt;br/> 5.Place tube on ice and proceed to 'Clean-up of double stranded cDNA', or transfer tube to dry ice, freeze and store at -80oC. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> C. Clean-up of double stranded cDNA 25.09.02. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1. Double stranded cRNA clean up is carried out using the GeneChipý Sample Cleanup Module, Affymetrix 900371. Prepare reagents following the instructions in the kit. &lt;br/> 2. Perform the clean up in a 1.5 or 2ml microfuge tube. &lt;br/> 3. Ensure ethanol has been added to cDNA Wash Buffer before use. &lt;br/> 4. After the clean up, ALL of the double stranded cDNA is used for the in vitro transcription reaction. Do not attempt to quantify the products of the reaction. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Add 600µl cDNA Binding Buffer to the cDNA reaction. Mix by pipetting. &lt;br/> 2. Check that the colour of the mixture is yellow (If the colour is orange or violet, add 10µl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0 and mix). &lt;br/> 3.

Clean-up of cRNA 07.03.03. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1.Removal of unincorporated biotinylated ribonucleotides is very important &lt;br/> obtaining a good quality scan.&lt;br/> 2. cRNA clean up is carried out using the GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module,Affymetrix 900371. Prepare reagents following the instructions in the kit.&lt;br/> 3. Ensure ethanol has been added to IVT cRNA Wash Buffer before use. &lt;br/> 4. Be careful not to touch the tip of the spin column at any time. &lt;br/> 5. Carry out centrifugation at >= 8,000g (>= 10,000rpm). &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method: &lt;br/>  1.Add to the in vitro transcription reaction tubes: &lt;br/>  60µl nuclease free dH2O &lt;br/>  350µl IVT cRNA Binding Buffer &lt;br/> 2.Mix thoroughly by pipetting. &lt;br/> 3.Add 250µl (100%) ethanol. Mix by pipetting. Do not spin. &lt;br/> 4.Apply sample to an IVT cRNA Cleanup Spin Column. &lt;br/> 5.Spin at >= 8,000g (>= 10,000rpm) for 15 seconds. &lt;br/> 6.Transfer the spin column to a fresh 2ml collection tube.&lt;br/>  7.Add 500µl IVT cRNA Wash Buffer onto the spin column. &lt;br/> 8.Spin at >= 8,000g (>= 10,000rpm) for 15 seconds. &lt;br/> 9.Empty the collection tube. &lt;br/> 10.Add 500µl (80%) ethanol onto the spin column. &lt;br/> 11.Spin at >= 8,000g (>= 10,000rpm) for 15 seconds. &lt;br/> 12.Empty the collection tube. &lt;br/> 13.Open the cap of the spin column and centrifuge at maximum speed for 5 minutes to completely dry the membrane. &lt;br/> 14.Transfer spin column into a new 1.5ml Collection tube. &lt;br/> 15.Elute by placing 11µl of RNase-free water directly onto the middle of the spin column membrane. &lt;br/> 16.Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes. &lt;br/> 17.Spin at maximum speed for 1 minute. &lt;br/> 18.Add 10µl of RNase-free water directly onto the middle of the spin column membrane. &lt;br/> 19.Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes.&lt;br/>  20.Spin at maximum speed for 1 minute. &lt;br/> 21.Dilute an aliquot of the eluate with dH2O (not DEPC treated) and measure the absorbance at 260nm and 280nm. The dilution should be sufficient so that readings obtained are in the linear range for the spectrophotometer. Unless known otherwise assume this is between 0.1 and 0.4 absorbance units (try preparing a serial dilution, diluting 2µl of eluate in 48µl of dH2O and then this 50µl in 450µl of dH2O). The cRNA should be clean e.g. a ratio of the absorbances at 260nm to 280nm should be around 2.0, with an acceptable range of 1.9 to 2.1. You should have 40 to 110µg of cRNA (assuming that you started with 10µg total RNA where 1 OD260 unit is equivalent to 40µg/ml single stranded RNA). If you have a yield of less than 40µg of cRNA per reaction (per 10µg reaction of total RNA), we recommend that you do not use the cRNA, as there is likely to be a problem with sample preparation. &lt;br/> 22.Run a sample of the total RNA and cRNA for each sample (500ng to 1µg) on a denaturing 1% agarose gel along with a marker spanning 200bp to 3kb (a DNA marker gives a rough idea of the size). The cRNA product should be a smear from about 100bp to 2kb with a brighter region from 500bp to 1kb, there is an example image for guidance at the end of this protocol. Photograph the gel, so that the markers are easy to identify and label the lanes with the sample identifier. &lt;br/> 23.Freeze by placing tube on dry ice and store at 80 °C. &lt;br/> 24.Bring the cRNA to the Microarray Centre on dry ice (after prior consultation with Helen Banks or Nicola Cooley to arrange a convenient time). Note that each sample should be clearly labelled on both the top and side of each tube with the date (day, month, year e.g. 05.11.01) and the sample identifier. &lt;br/> In order to assess the quality of the cRNA samples, prior to hybridisation on test arrays, we also require the following information, for both the cRNA samples and the total RNA from which it was generated. &lt;br/>   (a) the raw absorbance readings &lt;br/>   (b) the ratio of the absorbances at 260nm and 280nm. &lt;br/>   (c) the cRNA yield from 10µg of total RNA. &lt;br/>   (d) an original photograph of the gel, with the markers and samples labelled.&lt;br/>  
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - TOTAL RNA EXTRACTION FROM TISSUES &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Homogenize tissue samples in mortar with excess amount of liquid nitrogen. Measure the weight of homogenized samples.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Transfer 50-100 mg of tissues in 50ml tube having 3 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Homogenize the samples using Tekmars TISSUMIZER or Polytron or equivalent. Always keep the tube in ice so as to prevent the overheating.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Optional Step: Additional step may be required for samples with high content of proteins, fat, polysaccharides or extra cellular materials such as muscles, fat tissue and tuberous parts of the plants. Following homogenisation, remove insoluble materials by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 minutes at 2-4 .C. The resulting pellet contains insoluble materials and the supernatant contains RNA. In samples from fat tissue, an excess of fat collects as a top layer, which should be removed. Transfer the clear homogenate solution in a fresh tube.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Phase Separation: Incubate the sample at 15 to 30 .C (RT) for 5 minutes to permit for the complete dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes. Add 0.2 ml of chloroform (high grade) per 1 ml of TRIzol reagent.  Shake tubes vigorously for 15 seconds and incubate them at 15 to 30 .C (RT) for 2 to 3 minutes. Centrifuge the samples at 12000 g for 15 mints at 2 to 4.C. Following centrifugation; the mixture separates into a lower red, phenol-chloroform phase, an interphase, and a colourless upper aqueous phase. RNA remains exclusively in the aqueous phase. The volume of the aqueous phase is about 60% of the volume of TRIzol used for homogenisation.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> RNA Precipitation: Transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh tube and save the organic phase if isolation of DNA or protein is desired. Precipitate RNA from the aqueous phase by mixing with isopropyl alcohol. Use 0.5 ml of Isopropyl alcohol for every 1ml of TRIzol used. Incubate samples at 15 to 30 .C for 10 minutes and centrifuge at 12000g for 10 minutes at 2-4.C.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Remove the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet. Wash the RNA pellet once with 75% alcohol, adding at least 1ml of 75% ethanol for every 1 ml of TRIzol used. Mix the sample by vortexing slowly and centrifuge at 7500 g for 5 minutes at 2-4.C. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Remove the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet. Dry the RNA pellet in air for 10 minutes. Dissolve the RNA pellet in 100 ul of RNase free water. Pipette out few times and transfer in eppendorf tube and store in 70.C. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>                Total RNA is further cleaned up by using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) Cat No:74104 &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Step 1: 350ul of RLT buffer is required for each total RNA sample. Take the aliquot required in a tube (If you are going to clean 10 samples, calculate for 12 samples and take 12*350= 4.2 ml) and add 10ul of B-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Molecular Biology Grade) per 1ml of RLT buffer (42ul for 4.2 ml of RLT buffer).&lt;br/> Step 2: Add 350 of RLT Buffer (B-Mercaptoethanol added) to 100ul of total RNA sample (if the volume is less make up to 100ul) and mix thoroughly. Add 250ul of 100% ethanol. Mix well by pipetting. Do not centrifuge.&lt;br/> Step 3: Apply sample (Should be around 700ul) to an RNeasy mini spin column, sitting in a collection tube. Centrifuge in cold for 20 sec at 8000g. You can apply the flow through in the column for twice to improve the yield. Discard the flow through as well the tube after repeating step 3 twice. Keep the column in a fresh 2ml tube.&lt;br/> Step 4: Apply 500ul of RPE buffer (please make sure that alcohol is added in RPE buffer) on to the column. Centrifuge for 15 sec at 8000g. Discard the flow through.&lt;br/> Step 5: Apply 500ul of RPE buffer and centrifuge for 2 min at max speed. Discard the flow through. Spin again at max speed for a minute. Transfer the column in a fresh RNase free collection tube. &lt;br/> Step 6: Pipette 30ul of RNase free water on to the column. Heat the sample at 55.C for not more than 2 minutes (to get maximum yield). Centrifuge at 8000g for a minute. Repeat step 6 once more  to get 60ul of clean total RNA and proceed with QC and OD measurements. It is always to better keep the stock in two-three aliquots (to avoid freeze-thaw cycle) before freezing them in dry ice and transfer them to -80.&lt;br/> &lt;br/></field>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Hybridization - Hybridisation and Staining Protocols &lt;br/> These are the protocols used by the Microarray Centre to process labelled cRNA for GeneChip experiments, There are several protocols which can be used and their use is determined by the state of the cRNA and the type of chip being used. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>  1.Hybridisation of fragmented cRNA to GeneChip &lt;br/>  2.Preparation of GeneChip Station &lt;br/>  3.Either: a. Test 3 Processing b. Genome scale array processing &lt;br/>  4.Shutdown of GeneChip Station &lt;br/> &lt;br/> A. Hybridisation of fragmented cRNA to GeneChip &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1. There are two septa on the back of the GeneChip. Whilst filling or emptying the hybridisation chamber through one septum, a pipette tip must be inserted into the other as a vent. &lt;br/> 2. The more you inset/remove tips into the septa, the looser they will become. Eventually they will start to leak. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Equilibrate array at room temperature for 30 minutes before use. &lt;br/> 2. Heat frozen fragmented cRNA at 99oC for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 3. During incubation, pre-wet the array by filling with 200µl (100µl for test or mini arrays) of 1x hybridisation Buffer. Incubate in rotisserie oven at 45oC, 60rpm for 10 minutes. &lt;br/> 4. Cool fragmented cRNA at 45oC for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 5. To bring any particulate matter to the bottom of the tube, spin fragmented cRNA at maximum speed (ý13,000g) for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 6. Remove buffer solution from array, ensuring that all solution is removed. &lt;br/> 7. Add 200µl (100µl for test or mini array) of fragmented cRNA avoiding any debris at the bottom of the tube. &lt;br/> 8. Hybridise in rotisserie oven at 45oC, 60rpm, for 16 hours (overnight). &lt;br/> 9. Store remaining volume of fragmented cRNA at 20oC. &lt;br/> 10. After hybridization, proceed to Preparation of GeneChip station. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> B. Preparation of GeneChip station &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note:&lt;br/>  1. Scanner must be switched on before launching Microarray Suite. When the scanner is switched on, yellow and green lights should illuminate. If there is a problem the red light will come on, or the yellow and green lights will flash. When the scanner is warmed the yellow light is extinguished. &lt;br/> 2. When entering experiment info in step (4), complete experiment name, array type, array lot, operator name, and sample type (cRNA). If known fill in sample description and insert Target ID in sample project. &lt;br/> 3. If a fluidics station has already been used and wash solutions have not been changed, steps (7-9) will not be necessary. &lt;br/> 4. In step (7) take care not to touch the hoses. &lt;br/> 5. In step (8) prime all ports of a fluidics station even if they are not all required. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Switch on scanner. &lt;br/> 2. Login to computer. &lt;br/> 3. Launch Microarray Suite from desktop icon. &lt;br/> 4. From Tools menu select Defaults and then File Locations to check the location in which the files will be saved. &lt;br/> 5. Open Expts dialogue box. Complete as much information as possible and then save experiment. If performing wash and stain with antibody amplification, create 2 copies of each experiment. For one, mark the end of the experiment name with ba (before antibody); mark the other with aa (after antibody). Once all experiments have been entered close dialogue box. &lt;br/> 6. Turn on sufficient fluidics stations. Replace bottles of RNase free dH2O with the appropriate bottles of wash solutions and empty the waste bottle. &lt;br/> 7. Open Fluidics dialogue box of appropriate station and run Prime wash protocol on all ports. In fluidics station LCD window 'Remove vial will appear. Lift vial and needle up, an audible click will be heard and LCD window will display Load empty vial. Replace vial into sample holder. The port should start priming. &lt;br/> 8. Once priming has been completed the instruction to Remove vial will reappear. Lift vial and needle up as before. &lt;br/> 9. Proceed to desired wash and stain protocol. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> C.1 Test 3 GeneChip wash and stain &lt;br/> 05.03.02 &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1. The SAPE (streptavidin-phycoerythrin) is light sensitive. Do not expose it to light more than necessary, store in the dark at 4oC. For steps (3) and (4) prepare a master mix in an amber microfuge tube or a foil wrapped tube. Before addition, pulse-vortex for 30 seconds all reagents except for goat IgG and biotinylated antibody, these should me mixed by tapping thoroughly. Mix master mix thoroughly by tapping tube, spin briefly as necessary. Store aliquots on ice in a covered ice-tub. &lt;br/> 2.

 Labeling - cRNA preparation using phenol &lt;br/> These protocols are based on those provided by Affymetrix and include modifications from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, MIT, Boston and the CSC/IC Microarray Centre. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> A. First strand cDNA synthesis 5.11.01 &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> &lt;br/> 1.It is very important to start with good quality, clean, total RNA. Acceptable ratios for the absorbance of the total RNA at 260nm and 280nm are between 1.9 and 2.1. Ensure that the total RNA is diluted, so that the absorbances measured are in the linear range for the spectrophotometer. This is often between 0.1 and 0.4 absorbance units. &lt;br/> 2.For step (1) we recommend starting with 10µg total RNA per reaction tube. Do not start with less than 10µg total RNA per reaction. Carry out two reactions for each sample if you require more than 40µg of cRNA. &lt;br/> 3.Steps (3) and (4) are key to the preparation of cDNA. Step (3) breaks any secondary structures of the RNA while step (4) inhibits the reoccurrence of secondary structures. &lt;br/> 4.Make a 'master mix' for step (5). Mix thoroughly and spin briefly, as necessary. &lt;br/> 5.Use RNase free microfuge tubes and pipette tips throughout.&lt;br/>  &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1.

Second strand cDNA synthesis 12.02.01. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1.Check the units/µl for the RNase H, it is important that exactly 2U are used per reaction; you may have to adjust volumes accordingly. &lt;br/> 2.Make a 'master mix' for step (2). Mix thoroughly because the enzymes are in glycerol. Spin briefly, as necessary. &lt;br/> 3.For step (4), incubate either in a water bath in the cold room or in a refrigerated block with a lid, to reduce condensation. &lt;br/> 4.For step (5), store at -80oC only if you cannot go to the 'Clean-up of double stranded cDNA' step immediately after the second strand cDNA synthesis is completed. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1.Place all reagents and first strand reaction tubes on ice. Assemble master mix on ice. &lt;br/> 2.Prepare a master mix in a new microfuge tube.

The dilution should be sufficient so that readings obtained are in the linear range for the spectrophotometer. Unless known otherwise assume this is between 0.1 and 0.4 absorbance units (try preparing a serial dilution, diluting 2µl of eluate in 48µl of dH2O and then this 50µl in 450µl of dH2O). The cRNA should be clean e.g. a ratio of the absorbances at 260nm to 280nm should be around 2.0, with an acceptable range of 1.9 to 2.1. You should have 40 to 110µg of cRNA (assuming that you started with 10µg total RNA where 1 OD260 unit is equivalent to 40µg/ml single stranded RNA). If you have a yield of less than 40µg of cRNA per reaction (per 10µg reaction of total RNA), we recommend that you do not use the cRNA, as there is likely to be a problem with sample preparation. &lt;br/> 22.Run a sample of the total RNA and cRNA for each sample (500ng to 1µg) on a denaturing 1% agarose gel along with a marker spanning 200bp to 3kb (a DNA marker gives a rough idea of the size). The cRNA product should be a smear from about 100bp to 2kb with a brighter region from 500bp to 1kb, there is an example image for guidance at the end of this protocol. Photograph the gel, so that the markers are easy to identify and label the lanes with the sample identifier. &lt;br/> 23.Freeze by placing tube on dry ice and store at 80 °C. &lt;br/> 24.Bring the cRNA to the Microarray Centre on dry ice (after prior consultation with Helen Banks or Nicola Cooley to arrange a convenient time). Note that each sample should be clearly labelled on both the top and side of each tube with the date (day, month, year e.g. 05.11.01) and the sample identifier. &lt;br/> In order to assess the quality of the cRNA samples, prior to hybridisation on test arrays, we also require the following information, for both the cRNA samples and the total RNA from which it was generated. &lt;br/>   (a) the raw absorbance readings &lt;br/>   (b) the ratio of the absorbances at 260nm and 280nm. &lt;br/>   (c) the cRNA yield from 10µg of total RNA. &lt;br/>   (d) an original photograph of the gel, with the markers and samples labelled.&lt;br/>  
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - TOTAL RNA EXTRACTION FROM TISSUES &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Homogenize tissue samples in mortar with excess amount of liquid nitrogen. Measure the weight of homogenized samples.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Transfer 50-100 mg of tissues in 50ml tube having 3 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Homogenize the samples using Tekmars TISSUMIZER or Polytron or equivalent. Always keep the tube in ice so as to prevent the overheating.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Optional Step: Additional step may be required for samples with high content of proteins, fat, polysaccharides or extra cellular materials such as muscles, fat tissue and tuberous parts of the plants. Following homogenisation, remove insoluble materials by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 minutes at 2-4 .C. The resulting pellet contains insoluble materials and the supernatant contains RNA. In samples from fat tissue, an excess of fat collects as a top layer, which should be removed. Transfer the clear homogenate solution in a fresh tube.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Phase Separation: Incubate the sample at 15 to 30 .C (RT) for 5 minutes to permit for the complete dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes. Add 0.2 ml of chloroform (high grade) per 1 ml of TRIzol reagent.  Shake tubes vigorously for 15 seconds and incubate them at 15 to 30 .C (RT) for 2 to 3 minutes. Centrifuge the samples at 12000 g for 15 mints at 2 to 4.C. Following centrifugation; the mixture separates into a lower red, phenol-chloroform phase, an interphase, and a colourless upper aqueous phase. RNA remains exclusively in the aqueous phase. The volume of the aqueous phase is about 60% of the volume of TRIzol used for homogenisation.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> RNA Precipitation: Transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh tube and save the organic phase if isolation of DNA or protein is desired. Precipitate RNA from the aqueous phase by mixing with isopropyl alcohol. Use 0.5 ml of Isopropyl alcohol for every 1ml of TRIzol used. Incubate samples at 15 to 30 .C for 10 minutes and centrifuge at 12000g for 10 minutes at 2-4.C.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Remove the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet. Wash the RNA pellet once with 75% alcohol, adding at least 1ml of 75% ethanol for every 1 ml of TRIzol used. Mix the sample by vortexing slowly and centrifuge at 7500 g for 5 minutes at 2-4.C. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Remove the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet. Dry the RNA pellet in air for 10 minutes. Dissolve the RNA pellet in 100 ul of RNase free water. Pipette out few times and transfer in eppendorf tube and store in 70.C. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>                Total RNA is further cleaned up by using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) Cat No:74104 &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Step 1: 350ul of RLT buffer is required for each total RNA sample. Take the aliquot required in a tube (If you are going to clean 10 samples, calculate for 12 samples and take 12*350= 4.2 ml) and add 10ul of B-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Molecular Biology Grade) per 1ml of RLT buffer (42ul for 4.2 ml of RLT buffer).&lt;br/> Step 2: Add 350 of RLT Buffer (B-Mercaptoethanol added) to 100ul of total RNA sample (if the volume is less make up to 100ul) and mix thoroughly. Add 250ul of 100% ethanol. Mix well by pipetting. Do not centrifuge.&lt;br/> Step 3: Apply sample (Should be around 700ul) to an RNeasy mini spin column, sitting in a collection tube. Centrifuge in cold for 20 sec at 8000g. You can apply the flow through in the column for twice to improve the yield. Discard the flow through as well the tube after repeating step 3 twice. Keep the column in a fresh 2ml tube.&lt;br/> Step 4: Apply 500ul of RPE buffer (please make sure that alcohol is added in RPE buffer) on to the column. Centrifuge for 15 sec at 8000g. Discard the flow through.&lt;br/> Step 5: Apply 500ul of RPE buffer and centrifuge for 2 min at max speed. Discard the flow through. Spin again at max speed for a minute. Transfer the column in a fresh RNase free collection tube. &lt;br/> Step 6: Pipette 30ul of RNase free water on to the column. Heat the sample at 55.C for not more than 2 minutes (to get maximum yield). Centrifuge at 8000g for a minute. Repeat step 6 once more  to get 60ul of clean total RNA and proceed with QC and OD measurements. It is always to better keep the stock in two-three aliquots (to avoid freeze-thaw cycle) before freezing them in dry ice and transfer them to -80.&lt;br/> &lt;br/></field>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Hybridization - Hybridisation and Staining Protocols &lt;br/> These are the protocols used by the Microarray Centre to process labelled cRNA for GeneChip experiments, There are several protocols which can be used and their use is determined by the state of the cRNA and the type of chip being used. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>  1.Hybridisation of fragmented cRNA to GeneChip &lt;br/>  2.Preparation of GeneChip Station &lt;br/>  3.Either: a. Test 3 Processing b. Genome scale array processing &lt;br/>  4.Shutdown of GeneChip Station &lt;br/> &lt;br/> A. Hybridisation of fragmented cRNA to GeneChip &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1. There are two septa on the back of the GeneChip. Whilst filling or emptying the hybridisation chamber through one septum, a pipette tip must be inserted into the other as a vent. &lt;br/> 2. The more you inset/remove tips into the septa, the looser they will become. Eventually they will start to leak. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Equilibrate array at room temperature for 30 minutes before use. &lt;br/> 2. Heat frozen fragmented cRNA at 99oC for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 3. During incubation, pre-wet the array by filling with 200µl (100µl for test or mini arrays) of 1x hybridisation Buffer. Incubate in rotisserie oven at 45oC, 60rpm for 10 minutes. &lt;br/> 4. Cool fragmented cRNA at 45oC for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 5. To bring any particulate matter to the bottom of the tube, spin fragmented cRNA at maximum speed (ý13,000g) for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 6. Remove buffer solution from array, ensuring that all solution is removed. &lt;br/> 7. Add 200µl (100µl for test or mini array) of fragmented cRNA avoiding any debris at the bottom of the tube. &lt;br/> 8. Hybridise in rotisserie oven at 45oC, 60rpm, for 16 hours (overnight). &lt;br/> 9. Store remaining volume of fragmented cRNA at 20oC. &lt;br/> 10. After hybridization, proceed to Preparation of GeneChip station. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> B. Preparation of GeneChip station &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note:&lt;br/>  1. Scanner must be switched on before launching Microarray Suite. When the scanner is switched on, yellow and green lights should illuminate. If there is a problem the red light will come on, or the yellow and green lights will flash. When the scanner is warmed the yellow light is extinguished. &lt;br/> 2. When entering experiment info in step (4), complete experiment name, array type, array lot, operator name, and sample type (cRNA). If known fill in sample description and insert Target ID in sample project. &lt;br/> 3. If a fluidics station has already been used and wash solutions have not been changed, steps (7-9) will not be necessary. &lt;br/> 4. In step (7) take care not to touch the hoses. &lt;br/> 5. In step (8) prime all ports of a fluidics station even if they are not all required. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Switch on scanner. &lt;br/> 2. Login to computer. &lt;br/> 3. Launch Microarray Suite from desktop icon. &lt;br/> 4. From Tools menu select Defaults and then File Locations to check the location in which the files will be saved. &lt;br/> 5. Open Expts dialogue box. Complete as much information as possible and then save experiment. If performing wash and stain with antibody amplification, create 2 copies of each experiment. For one, mark the end of the experiment name with ba (before antibody); mark the other with aa (after antibody). Once all experiments have been entered close dialogue box. &lt;br/> 6. Turn on sufficient fluidics stations. Replace bottles of RNase free dH2O with the appropriate bottles of wash solutions and empty the waste bottle. &lt;br/> 7.

 Labeling - cRNA preparation using phenol &lt;br/> These protocols are based on those provided by Affymetrix and include modifications from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, MIT, Boston and the CSC/IC Microarray Centre. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> A. First strand cDNA synthesis 5.11.01 &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> &lt;br/> 1.It is very important to start with good quality, clean, total RNA. Acceptable ratios for the absorbance of the total RNA at 260nm and 280nm are between 1.9 and 2.1. Ensure that the total RNA is diluted, so that the absorbances measured are in the linear range for the spectrophotometer. This is often between 0.1 and 0.4 absorbance units. &lt;br/> 2.For step (1) we recommend starting with 10µg total RNA per reaction tube. Do not start with less than 10µg total RNA per reaction. Carry out two reactions for each sample if you require more than 40µg of cRNA. &lt;br/> 3.Steps (3) and (4) are key to the preparation of cDNA. Step (3) breaks any secondary structures of the RNA while step (4) inhibits the reoccurrence of secondary structures. &lt;br/> 4.Make a 'master mix' for step (5). Mix thoroughly and spin briefly, as necessary. &lt;br/> 5.Use RNase free microfuge tubes and pipette tips throughout.&lt;br/>  &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Place the following in a microfuge tube: &lt;br/>  -µl (10µg) total RNA in nuclease free treated dH2O &lt;br/>  -µl (100 pmol) T7-(T)24 primer &lt;br/>  (GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(T)24) &lt;br/>  1µl Poly A+ Controls &lt;br/>  -µl nuclease free dH2O &lt;br/>  11 µl final volume &lt;br/> 2.Mix by pipetting, spin briefly as necessary. &lt;br/> 3.Incubate at 65-70oC for 10 minutes. &lt;br/> 4.Place tubes on ice. &lt;br/> 5.Prepare a master mix on ice. The quantities are for each reaction/tube: &lt;br/>  4µl (5x) First Strand Buffer (thaw at 37oC, put on ice), Invitrogen Y02321 &lt;br/>  2µl (0.1 M) DTT, Invitrogen Y00147 &lt;br/>  1µl (10mM) dNTPs, Invitrogen 18427-013 &lt;br/>  7µl &lt;br/>  Mix by pipetting, spin briefly as necessary.Add 7µl of master mix to each reaction tube.&lt;br/>  6.Incubate at 42 oC for 2 minutes. &lt;br/> 7.Add 2µl Superscript II reverse transcriptase (400 U total), Invitrogen 18064-014. &lt;br/> 8.Tap tube to mix, spin briefly as necessary. &lt;br/> 9.Incubate at 42oC for 1 hour in a waterbath. &lt;br/> 10.Place tube on ice and proceed to 'Second strand cDNA synthesis', or transfer tube to dry ice, allow reaction to freeze and store at -80oC. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> B. Second strand cDNA synthesis 12.02.01. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1.Check the units/µl for the RNase H, it is important that exactly 2U are used per reaction; you may have to adjust volumes accordingly. &lt;br/> 2.Make a 'master mix' for step (2). Mix thoroughly because the enzymes are in glycerol. Spin briefly, as necessary. &lt;br/> 3.For step (4), incubate either in a water bath in the cold room or in a refrigerated block with a lid, to reduce condensation. &lt;br/> 4.For step (5), store at -80oC only if you cannot go to the 'Clean-up of double stranded cDNA' step immediately after the second strand cDNA synthesis is completed. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1.Place all reagents and first strand reaction tubes on ice. Assemble master mix on ice. &lt;br/> 2.Prepare a master mix in a new microfuge tube. For each reaction use: &lt;br/>  -µl nuclease free treated dH2O &lt;br/>  30µl (5x) Second Strand Buffer, Invitrogen 10812-014&lt;br/>  3µl (10mM) dNTPs, Invitrogen 18427-013 &lt;br/>  1µl DNA Ligase (10 Units), Invitrogen 18052-019 &lt;br/>  4µl DNA Pol I (40 Units), Invitrogen 18010-025 &lt;br/>  -µl RNase H (2 Units), Invitrogen 18021-071 &lt;br/>  130µl &lt;br/>  Mix by vortexing, spin briefly as necessary. Add 130µl of the master mix to each of the first strand reaction tubes. &lt;br/> 3.Mix by pipetting, spin briefly as necessary.&lt;br/> 4.Incubate at 16oC for 2 hours. Use a water bath in a cold room or a refrigerated block with lid, if possible. This reduces condensation. &lt;br/> 5.Place tube on ice and proceed to 'Clean-up of double stranded cDNA', or transfer tube to dry ice, freeze and store at -80oC. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> C. Clean-up of double stranded cDNA 25.09.02. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1. Double stranded cRNA clean up is carried out using the GeneChipý Sample Cleanup Module, Affymetrix 900371. Prepare reagents following the instructions in the kit. &lt;br/> 2. Perform the clean up in a 1.5 or 2ml microfuge tube. &lt;br/> 3. Ensure ethanol has been added to cDNA Wash Buffer before use. &lt;br/> 4. After the clean up, ALL of the double stranded cDNA is used for the in vitro transcription reaction. Do not attempt to quantify the products of the reaction. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Add 600µl cDNA Binding Buffer to the cDNA reaction. Mix by pipetting. &lt;br/> 2.

The dilution should be sufficient so that readings obtained are in the linear range for the spectrophotometer. Unless known otherwise assume this is between 0.1 and 0.4 absorbance units (try preparing a serial dilution, diluting 2µl of eluate in 48µl of dH2O and then this 50µl in 450µl of dH2O). The cRNA should be clean e.g. a ratio of the absorbances at 260nm to 280nm should be around 2.0, with an acceptable range of 1.9 to 2.1. You should have 40 to 110µg of cRNA (assuming that you started with 10µg total RNA where 1 OD260 unit is equivalent to 40µg/ml single stranded RNA). If you have a yield of less than 40µg of cRNA per reaction (per 10µg reaction of total RNA), we recommend that you do not use the cRNA, as there is likely to be a problem with sample preparation. &lt;br/> 22.Run a sample of the total RNA and cRNA for each sample (500ng to 1µg) on a denaturing 1% agarose gel along with a marker spanning 200bp to 3kb (a DNA marker gives a rough idea of the size). The cRNA product should be a smear from about 100bp to 2kb with a brighter region from 500bp to 1kb, there is an example image for guidance at the end of this protocol. Photograph the gel, so that the markers are easy to identify and label the lanes with the sample identifier. &lt;br/> 23.Freeze by placing tube on dry ice and store at 80 °C. &lt;br/> 24.Bring the cRNA to the Microarray Centre on dry ice (after prior consultation with Helen Banks or Nicola Cooley to arrange a convenient time). Note that each sample should be clearly labelled on both the top and side of each tube with the date (day, month, year e.g. 05.11.01) and the sample identifier. &lt;br/> In order to assess the quality of the cRNA samples, prior to hybridisation on test arrays, we also require the following information, for both the cRNA samples and the total RNA from which it was generated. &lt;br/>   (a) the raw absorbance readings &lt;br/>   (b) the ratio of the absorbances at 260nm and 280nm. &lt;br/>   (c) the cRNA yield from 10µg of total RNA. &lt;br/>   (d) an original photograph of the gel, with the markers and samples labelled.&lt;br/>  
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - TOTAL RNA EXTRACTION FROM TISSUES &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Homogenize tissue samples in mortar with excess amount of liquid nitrogen. Measure the weight of homogenized samples.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Transfer 50-100 mg of tissues in 50ml tube having 3 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Homogenize the samples using Tekmars TISSUMIZER or Polytron or equivalent. Always keep the tube in ice so as to prevent the overheating.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Optional Step: Additional step may be required for samples with high content of proteins, fat, polysaccharides or extra cellular materials such as muscles, fat tissue and tuberous parts of the plants. Following homogenisation, remove insoluble materials by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 minutes at 2-4 .C. The resulting pellet contains insoluble materials and the supernatant contains RNA. In samples from fat tissue, an excess of fat collects as a top layer, which should be removed. Transfer the clear homogenate solution in a fresh tube.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Phase Separation: Incubate the sample at 15 to 30 .C (RT) for 5 minutes to permit for the complete dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes. Add 0.2 ml of chloroform (high grade) per 1 ml of TRIzol reagent.  Shake tubes vigorously for 15 seconds and incubate them at 15 to 30 .C (RT) for 2 to 3 minutes. Centrifuge the samples at 12000 g for 15 mints at 2 to 4.C. Following centrifugation; the mixture separates into a lower red, phenol-chloroform phase, an interphase, and a colourless upper aqueous phase. RNA remains exclusively in the aqueous phase. The volume of the aqueous phase is about 60% of the volume of TRIzol used for homogenisation.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> RNA Precipitation: Transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh tube and save the organic phase if isolation of DNA or protein is desired. Precipitate RNA from the aqueous phase by mixing with isopropyl alcohol. Use 0.5 ml of Isopropyl alcohol for every 1ml of TRIzol used. Incubate samples at 15 to 30 .C for 10 minutes and centrifuge at 12000g for 10 minutes at 2-4.C.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Remove the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet. Wash the RNA pellet once with 75% alcohol, adding at least 1ml of 75% ethanol for every 1 ml of TRIzol used. Mix the sample by vortexing slowly and centrifuge at 7500 g for 5 minutes at 2-4.C. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Remove the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet. Dry the RNA pellet in air for 10 minutes. Dissolve the RNA pellet in 100 ul of RNase free water. Pipette out few times and transfer in eppendorf tube and store in 70.C. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>                Total RNA is further cleaned up by using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) Cat No:74104 &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Step 1: 350ul of RLT buffer is required for each total RNA sample. Take the aliquot required in a tube (If you are going to clean 10 samples, calculate for 12 samples and take 12*350= 4.2 ml) and add 10ul of B-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Molecular Biology Grade) per 1ml of RLT buffer (42ul for 4.2 ml of RLT buffer).&lt;br/> Step 2: Add 350 of RLT Buffer (B-Mercaptoethanol added) to 100ul of total RNA sample (if the volume is less make up to 100ul) and mix thoroughly. Add 250ul of 100% ethanol. Mix well by pipetting. Do not centrifuge.&lt;br/> Step 3: Apply sample (Should be around 700ul) to an RNeasy mini spin column, sitting in a collection tube. Centrifuge in cold for 20 sec at 8000g. You can apply the flow through in the column for twice to improve the yield. Discard the flow through as well the tube after repeating step 3 twice. Keep the column in a fresh 2ml tube.&lt;br/> Step 4: Apply 500ul of RPE buffer (please make sure that alcohol is added in RPE buffer) on to the column. Centrifuge for 15 sec at 8000g. Discard the flow through.&lt;br/> Step 5: Apply 500ul of RPE buffer and centrifuge for 2 min at max speed. Discard the flow through. Spin again at max speed for a minute. Transfer the column in a fresh RNase free collection tube. &lt;br/> Step 6: Pipette 30ul of RNase free water on to the column. Heat the sample at 55.C for not more than 2 minutes (to get maximum yield). Centrifuge at 8000g for a minute. Repeat step 6 once more  to get 60ul of clean total RNA and proceed with QC and OD measurements. It is always to better keep the stock in two-three aliquots (to avoid freeze-thaw cycle) before freezing them in dry ice and transfer them to -80.&lt;br/> &lt;br/></field>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Hybridization - Hybridisation and Staining Protocols &lt;br/> These are the protocols used by the Microarray Centre to process labelled cRNA for GeneChip experiments, There are several protocols which can be used and their use is determined by the state of the cRNA and the type of chip being used. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>  1.Hybridisation of fragmented cRNA to GeneChip &lt;br/>  2.Preparation of GeneChip Station &lt;br/>  3.Either: a. Test 3 Processing b. Genome scale array processing &lt;br/>  4.Shutdown of GeneChip Station &lt;br/> &lt;br/> A. Hybridisation of fragmented cRNA to GeneChip &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1. There are two septa on the back of the GeneChip. Whilst filling or emptying the hybridisation chamber through one septum, a pipette tip must be inserted into the other as a vent. &lt;br/> 2. The more you inset/remove tips into the septa, the looser they will become. Eventually they will start to leak. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Equilibrate array at room temperature for 30 minutes before use. &lt;br/> 2. Heat frozen fragmented cRNA at 99oC for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 3. During incubation, pre-wet the array by filling with 200µl (100µl for test or mini arrays) of 1x hybridisation Buffer. Incubate in rotisserie oven at 45oC, 60rpm for 10 minutes. &lt;br/> 4. Cool fragmented cRNA at 45oC for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 5. To bring any particulate matter to the bottom of the tube, spin fragmented cRNA at maximum speed (ý13,000g) for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 6. Remove buffer solution from array, ensuring that all solution is removed. &lt;br/> 7. Add 200µl (100µl for test or mini array) of fragmented cRNA avoiding any debris at the bottom of the tube. &lt;br/> 8. Hybridise in rotisserie oven at 45oC, 60rpm, for 16 hours (overnight). &lt;br/> 9. Store remaining volume of fragmented cRNA at 20oC. &lt;br/> 10. After hybridization, proceed to Preparation of GeneChip station. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> B. Preparation of GeneChip station &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note:&lt;br/>  1.

 Labeling - cRNA preparation using phenol &lt;br/> These protocols are based on those provided by Affymetrix and include modifications from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, MIT, Boston and the CSC/IC Microarray Centre. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> A. First strand cDNA synthesis 5.11.01 &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> &lt;br/> 1.It is very important to start with good quality, clean, total RNA. Acceptable ratios for the absorbance of the total RNA at 260nm and 280nm are between 1.9 and 2.1. Ensure that the total RNA is diluted, so that the absorbances measured are in the linear range for the spectrophotometer. This is often between 0.1 and 0.4 absorbance units. &lt;br/> 2.For step (1) we recommend starting with 10µg total RNA per reaction tube. Do not start with less than 10µg total RNA per reaction. Carry out two reactions for each sample if you require more than 40µg of cRNA. &lt;br/> 3.Steps (3) and (4) are key to the preparation of cDNA. Step (3) breaks any secondary structures of the RNA while step (4) inhibits the reoccurrence of secondary structures. &lt;br/> 4.Make a 'master mix' for step (5). Mix thoroughly and spin briefly, as necessary. &lt;br/> 5.Use RNase free microfuge tubes and pipette tips throughout.&lt;br/>  &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Place the following in a microfuge tube: &lt;br/>  -µl (10µg) total RNA in nuclease free treated dH2O &lt;br/>  -µl (100 pmol) T7-(T)24 primer &lt;br/>  (GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(T)24) &lt;br/>  1µl Poly A+ Controls &lt;br/>  -µl nuclease free dH2O &lt;br/>  11 µl final volume &lt;br/> 2.Mix by pipetting, spin briefly as necessary. &lt;br/> 3.Incubate at 65-70oC for 10 minutes. &lt;br/> 4.Place tubes on ice. &lt;br/> 5.Prepare a master mix on ice. The quantities are for each reaction/tube: &lt;br/>  4µl (5x) First Strand Buffer (thaw at 37oC, put on ice), Invitrogen Y02321 &lt;br/>  2µl (0.1 M) DTT, Invitrogen Y00147 &lt;br/>  1µl (10mM) dNTPs, Invitrogen 18427-013 &lt;br/>  7µl &lt;br/>  Mix by pipetting, spin briefly as necessary.Add 7µl of master mix to each reaction tube.&lt;br/>  6.Incubate at 42 oC for 2 minutes. &lt;br/> 7.Add 2µl Superscript II reverse transcriptase (400 U total), Invitrogen 18064-014. &lt;br/> 8.Tap tube to mix, spin briefly as necessary. &lt;br/> 9.Incubate at 42oC for 1 hour in a waterbath. &lt;br/> 10.Place tube on ice and proceed to 'Second strand cDNA synthesis', or transfer tube to dry ice, allow reaction to freeze and store at -80oC. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> B. Second strand cDNA synthesis 12.02.01. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1.Check the units/µl for the RNase H, it is important that exactly 2U are used per reaction; you may have to adjust volumes accordingly. &lt;br/> 2.Make a 'master mix' for step (2). Mix thoroughly because the enzymes are in glycerol. Spin briefly, as necessary. &lt;br/> 3.For step (4), incubate either in a water bath in the cold room or in a refrigerated block with a lid, to reduce condensation. &lt;br/> 4.For step (5), store at -80oC only if you cannot go to the 'Clean-up of double stranded cDNA' step immediately after the second strand cDNA synthesis is completed. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1.Place all reagents and first strand reaction tubes on ice. Assemble master mix on ice. &lt;br/> 2.Prepare a master mix in a new microfuge tube. For each reaction use: &lt;br/>  -µl nuclease free treated dH2O &lt;br/>  30µl (5x) Second Strand Buffer, Invitrogen 10812-014&lt;br/>  3µl (10mM) dNTPs, Invitrogen 18427-013 &lt;br/>  1µl DNA Ligase (10 Units), Invitrogen 18052-019 &lt;br/>  4µl DNA Pol I (40 Units), Invitrogen 18010-025 &lt;br/>  -µl RNase H (2 Units), Invitrogen 18021-071 &lt;br/>  130µl &lt;br/>  Mix by vortexing, spin briefly as necessary. Add 130µl of the master mix to each of the first strand reaction tubes. &lt;br/> 3.Mix by pipetting, spin briefly as necessary.&lt;br/> 4.Incubate at 16oC for 2 hours. Use a water bath in a cold room or a refrigerated block with lid, if possible. This reduces condensation. &lt;br/> 5.Place tube on ice and proceed to 'Clean-up of double stranded cDNA', or transfer tube to dry ice, freeze and store at -80oC. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> C. Clean-up of double stranded cDNA 25.09.02. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1. Double stranded cRNA clean up is carried out using the GeneChipý Sample Cleanup Module, Affymetrix 900371. Prepare reagents following the instructions in the kit. &lt;br/> 2. Perform the clean up in a 1.5 or 2ml microfuge tube. &lt;br/> 3. Ensure ethanol has been added to cDNA Wash Buffer before use. &lt;br/> 4. After the clean up, ALL of the double stranded cDNA is used for the in vitro transcription reaction. Do not attempt to quantify the products of the reaction. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Add 600µl cDNA Binding Buffer to the cDNA reaction. Mix by pipetting. &lt;br/> 2.

Clean-up of cRNA 07.03.03. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1.Removal of unincorporated biotinylated ribonucleotides is very important &lt;br/> obtaining a good quality scan.&lt;br/> 2. cRNA clean up is carried out using the GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module,Affymetrix 900371. Prepare reagents following the instructions in the kit.&lt;br/> 3. Ensure ethanol has been added to IVT cRNA Wash Buffer before use. &lt;br/> 4. Be careful not to touch the tip of the spin column at any time. &lt;br/> 5. Carry out centrifugation at >= 8,000g (>= 10,000rpm). &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method: &lt;br/>  1.Add to the in vitro transcription reaction tubes: &lt;br/>  60µl nuclease free dH2O &lt;br/>  350µl IVT cRNA Binding Buffer &lt;br/> 2.Mix thoroughly by pipetting. &lt;br/> 3.Add 250µl (100%) ethanol.

Do not spin. &lt;br/> 4.Apply sample to an IVT cRNA Cleanup Spin Column. &lt;br/> 5.Spin at >= 8,000g (>= 10,000rpm) for 15 seconds. &lt;br/> 6.Transfer the spin column to a fresh 2ml collection tube.&lt;br/>  7.Add 500µl IVT cRNA Wash Buffer onto the spin column. &lt;br/> 8.Spin at >= 8,000g (>= 10,000rpm) for 15 seconds. &lt;br/> 9.Empty the collection tube. &lt;br/> 10.Add 500µl (80%) ethanol onto the spin column. &lt;br/> 11.Spin at >= 8,000g (>= 10,000rpm) for 15 seconds. &lt;br/> 12.Empty the collection tube. &lt;br/> 13.Open the cap of the spin column and centrifuge at maximum speed for 5 minutes to completely dry the membrane. &lt;br/> 14.Transfer spin column into a new 1.5ml Collection tube. &lt;br/> 15.Elute by placing 11µl of RNase-free water directly onto the middle of the spin column membrane. &lt;br/> 16.Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes. &lt;br/> 17.Spin at maximum speed for 1 minute. &lt;br/> 18.Add 10µl of RNase-free water directly onto the middle of the spin column membrane. &lt;br/> 19.Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes.&lt;br/>  20.Spin at maximum speed for 1 minute. &lt;br/> 21.Dilute an aliquot of the eluate with dH2O (not DEPC treated) and measure the absorbance at 260nm and 280nm. The dilution should be sufficient so that readings obtained are in the linear range for the spectrophotometer. Unless known otherwise assume this is between 0.1 and 0.4 absorbance units (try preparing a serial dilution, diluting 2µl of eluate in 48µl of dH2O and then this 50µl in 450µl of dH2O). The cRNA should be clean e.g. a ratio of the absorbances at 260nm to 280nm should be around 2.0, with an acceptable range of 1.9 to 2.1. You should have 40 to 110µg of cRNA (assuming that you started with 10µg total RNA where 1 OD260 unit is equivalent to 40µg/ml single stranded RNA). If you have a yield of less than 40µg of cRNA per reaction (per 10µg reaction of total RNA), we recommend that you do not use the cRNA, as there is likely to be a problem with sample preparation. &lt;br/> 22.Run a sample of the total RNA and cRNA for each sample (500ng to 1µg) on a denaturing 1% agarose gel along with a marker spanning 200bp to 3kb (a DNA marker gives a rough idea of the size). The cRNA product should be a smear from about 100bp to 2kb with a brighter region from 500bp to 1kb, there is an example image for guidance at the end of this protocol. Photograph the gel, so that the markers are easy to identify and label the lanes with the sample identifier. &lt;br/> 23.Freeze by placing tube on dry ice and store at 80 °C. &lt;br/> 24.Bring the cRNA to the Microarray Centre on dry ice (after prior consultation with Helen Banks or Nicola Cooley to arrange a convenient time). Note that each sample should be clearly labelled on both the top and side of each tube with the date (day, month, year e.g. 05.11.01) and the sample identifier. &lt;br/> In order to assess the quality of the cRNA samples, prior to hybridisation on test arrays, we also require the following information, for both the cRNA samples and the total RNA from which it was generated. &lt;br/>   (a) the raw absorbance readings &lt;br/>   (b) the ratio of the absorbances at 260nm and 280nm. &lt;br/>   (c) the cRNA yield from 10µg of total RNA. &lt;br/>   (d) an original photograph of the gel, with the markers and samples labelled.&lt;br/>  
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - TOTAL RNA EXTRACTION FROM TISSUES &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Homogenize tissue samples in mortar with excess amount of liquid nitrogen. Measure the weight of homogenized samples.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Transfer 50-100 mg of tissues in 50ml tube having 3 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Homogenize the samples using Tekmars TISSUMIZER or Polytron or equivalent. Always keep the tube in ice so as to prevent the overheating.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Optional Step: Additional step may be required for samples with high content of proteins, fat, polysaccharides or extra cellular materials such as muscles, fat tissue and tuberous parts of the plants. Following homogenisation, remove insoluble materials by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 minutes at 2-4 .C. The resulting pellet contains insoluble materials and the supernatant contains RNA. In samples from fat tissue, an excess of fat collects as a top layer, which should be removed. Transfer the clear homogenate solution in a fresh tube.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Phase Separation: Incubate the sample at 15 to 30 .C (RT) for 5 minutes to permit for the complete dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes. Add 0.2 ml of chloroform (high grade) per 1 ml of TRIzol reagent.  Shake tubes vigorously for 15 seconds and incubate them at 15 to 30 .C (RT) for 2 to 3 minutes. Centrifuge the samples at 12000 g for 15 mints at 2 to 4.C. Following centrifugation; the mixture separates into a lower red, phenol-chloroform phase, an interphase, and a colourless upper aqueous phase. RNA remains exclusively in the aqueous phase. The volume of the aqueous phase is about 60% of the volume of TRIzol used for homogenisation.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> RNA Precipitation: Transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh tube and save the organic phase if isolation of DNA or protein is desired. Precipitate RNA from the aqueous phase by mixing with isopropyl alcohol. Use 0.5 ml of Isopropyl alcohol for every 1ml of TRIzol used. Incubate samples at 15 to 30 .C for 10 minutes and centrifuge at 12000g for 10 minutes at 2-4.C.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Remove the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet. Wash the RNA pellet once with 75% alcohol, adding at least 1ml of 75% ethanol for every 1 ml of TRIzol used. Mix the sample by vortexing slowly and centrifuge at 7500 g for 5 minutes at 2-4.C. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Remove the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet. Dry the RNA pellet in air for 10 minutes. Dissolve the RNA pellet in 100 ul of RNase free water. Pipette out few times and transfer in eppendorf tube and store in 70.C. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>                Total RNA is further cleaned up by using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) Cat No:74104 &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Step 1: 350ul of RLT buffer is required for each total RNA sample. Take the aliquot required in a tube (If you are going to clean 10 samples, calculate for 12 samples and take 12*350= 4.2 ml) and add 10ul of B-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Molecular Biology Grade) per 1ml of RLT buffer (42ul for 4.2 ml of RLT buffer).&lt;br/> Step 2: Add 350 of RLT Buffer (B-Mercaptoethanol added) to 100ul of total RNA sample (if the volume is less make up to 100ul) and mix thoroughly. Add 250ul of 100% ethanol. Mix well by pipetting. Do not centrifuge.&lt;br/> Step 3: Apply sample (Should be around 700ul) to an RNeasy mini spin column, sitting in a collection tube. Centrifuge in cold for 20 sec at 8000g. You can apply the flow through in the column for twice to improve the yield. Discard the flow through as well the tube after repeating step 3 twice. Keep the column in a fresh 2ml tube.&lt;br/> Step 4: Apply 500ul of RPE buffer (please make sure that alcohol is added in RPE buffer) on to the column. Centrifuge for 15 sec at 8000g. Discard the flow through.&lt;br/> Step 5: Apply 500ul of RPE buffer and centrifuge for 2 min at max speed. Discard the flow through. Spin again at max speed for a minute. Transfer the column in a fresh RNase free collection tube. &lt;br/> Step 6: Pipette 30ul of RNase free water on to the column. Heat the sample at 55.C for not more than 2 minutes (to get maximum yield). Centrifuge at 8000g for a minute. Repeat step 6 once more  to get 60ul of clean total RNA and proceed with QC and OD measurements. It is always to better keep the stock in two-three aliquots (to avoid freeze-thaw cycle) before freezing them in dry ice and transfer them to -80.&lt;br/> &lt;br/></field>

        <field name="data_protocol">Image Adquisition - Separate images were acquired for each dye at a resolution of 10 µm per pixel. Intensities of the fluorescent signals were quantified using Imagene 4.2 (BioDiscovery, Inc.).  The signals were focused using a row of spots within the middle of the array and normalized such that the Cy3 and Cy5 channels are matched at similar signal intensities as high as possible but avoiding a large percentage of saturated signals over the entire array.  The laser and PMT settings were adjusted to each channel individually such that the laser setting controlled the signal intensity and the PMT was set 5% higher.  The quantification of the spot intensities was performed by the Imagene 4.2 (BioDiscovery, Inc) program.  The grid spots were adjusted to the array spot by the program find spots algorithm for consistency.</field>

 Hybridization - Catma miror slides (Amersham Biosciences) are pretreated in the prehybridisation solution (1 % BSA, 0.1 SDS, 5X SSC ) at 42°C for 60 min. They are dipped a couple of times in distilled water at room temperature, then in isopropanol and dried immediately by  compressed nitrogen stream. Slides were placed in Corning hybridization chambers with a 25x60 lifterslip and 10ul of distilled water  for each groove. The target was diluted to a final volume of  60 µL as follows: 15µl of purified, labeled cDNA, 15 µl of 4X Hybridization Buffer ( 20X SDS, 0.4 % SDS), 30 µL formamide. The target mixture is heated for 3 min at 95°C, put on ice for 30 sec and centrifuged to remove dust for 1 min. The target mixture was put on the chip as quickly as possible. The microarray is sealed in a chamber and submerged in a 42°C water bath for approximately 16 h. The microarray is washed for 4 min in 1xSSC, 0.2% SDS (42°C); 4 min in 0.1x SSC, 0.2% SDS (RT); 4 min in 0.1x SSC, 0.2% SDS (RT); 4 min in 0.1x SSC (RT); dipped a few times in distilled water and dried immediately by compressed nitrogen stream.
 Labeling - 5 µg of aRNA (8µl) mixed with 2 µl of random nonamers 1µg/µl and 0.5 µl of RNAse Out 40 U/µl, denatured 10 min at 70 °C  and chilled on ice. The followig components were added to the sample: 4 µl of first strand buffer 5 X, 1 µl of 10 mM dNTP/2mM dCTP, 2 µl of 0.1 M DTT,  1.5 µl of Cy5-dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 25nmol tube, PA55021), 1 µl of SuperScript II RT 200U/µl. Then it was incubated at 42°C for 2.5 hours and  chilled on ice. The sample was denaturated by adding 2 µl of NaOH 2.5M and incubated at 37 °C for exactly 15 min,  then was added  10 µl of 2M MOPS and put on ice. The dyes were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN).   
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Plant tissue was ground to fine powder using liquid nitrogen in a 2mL eppendorf tube. The samples were homogenized in TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) : 1 mL for 50-100 mg of plant tissue,  by vortexing and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Chloroform (200µl/1mL TRIzol) was added and the capped tubes were hand-shaken for 15 sec. They were incubated for 2-3 min, then centrifuged for 15 min at 11000 rpm  at 4°C. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new 1.5 mL tube and 500ul of isopropanol was added. The samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature then centrifuged for 10 min at 11000 rpm at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed with 1 mL of 75% ethanol in DEPC-treated water. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 11000 rpm at 4°C. The pellet was air-dried for 10 min at room-temperature, then  resuspended in 500 µl DEPC-treated  water, and precipated with 2 volumes of  100 % ethanol and  1/10 V of  Sodium acetate 3M, pH5,2. The samples were precipitated 30 min at 20 °C  and centrifuged for 15 min at 10000 rpm at 4°C. The supernatant was removed, the pellet was air-dried and resuspended in DEPC-treated water. Quality assessment was performed with an Agilent Technologies Bioanalyser 2100 and the Ribogreen method.  2-5 µg of total RNA was amplified to aRNA using the Ambion MessageAmp Kit (Ambion, #1750).</field>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Hybridization - Hybridisation and Staining Protocols &lt;br/> These are the protocols used by the Microarray Centre to process labelled cRNA for GeneChip experiments, There are several protocols which can be used and their use is determined by the state of the cRNA and the type of chip being used. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>  1.Hybridisation of fragmented cRNA to GeneChip &lt;br/>  2.Preparation of GeneChip Station &lt;br/>  3.Either: a. Test 3 Processing b. Genome scale array processing &lt;br/>  4.Shutdown of GeneChip Station &lt;br/> &lt;br/> A. Hybridisation of fragmented cRNA to GeneChip &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1. There are two septa on the back of the GeneChip. Whilst filling or emptying the hybridisation chamber through one septum, a pipette tip must be inserted into the other as a vent. &lt;br/> 2. The more you inset/remove tips into the septa, the looser they will become. Eventually they will start to leak. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Equilibrate array at room temperature for 30 minutes before use. &lt;br/> 2. Heat frozen fragmented cRNA at 99oC for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 3. During incubation, pre-wet the array by filling with 200µl (100µl for test or mini arrays) of 1x hybridisation Buffer. Incubate in rotisserie oven at 45oC, 60rpm for 10 minutes. &lt;br/> 4. Cool fragmented cRNA at 45oC for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 5. To bring any particulate matter to the bottom of the tube, spin fragmented cRNA at maximum speed (ý13,000g) for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 6. Remove buffer solution from array, ensuring that all solution is removed. &lt;br/> 7. Add 200µl (100µl for test or mini array) of fragmented cRNA avoiding any debris at the bottom of the tube. &lt;br/> 8. Hybridise in rotisserie oven at 45oC, 60rpm, for 16 hours (overnight). &lt;br/> 9. Store remaining volume of fragmented cRNA at 20oC. &lt;br/> 10. After hybridization, proceed to Preparation of GeneChip station. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> B. Preparation of GeneChip station &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note:&lt;br/>  1. Scanner must be switched on before launching Microarray Suite. When the scanner is switched on, yellow and green lights should illuminate. If there is a problem the red light will come on, or the yellow and green lights will flash. When the scanner is warmed the yellow light is extinguished. &lt;br/> 2. When entering experiment info in step (4), complete experiment name, array type, array lot, operator name, and sample type (cRNA). If known fill in sample description and insert Target ID in sample project. &lt;br/> 3. If a fluidics station has already been used and wash solutions have not been changed, steps (7-9) will not be necessary. &lt;br/> 4. In step (7) take care not to touch the hoses. &lt;br/> 5. In step (8) prime all ports of a fluidics station even if they are not all required. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Switch on scanner. &lt;br/> 2. Login to computer. &lt;br/> 3. Launch Microarray Suite from desktop icon. &lt;br/> 4. From Tools menu select Defaults and then File Locations to check the location in which the files will be saved. &lt;br/> 5. Open Expts dialogue box. Complete as much information as possible and then save experiment. If performing wash and stain with antibody amplification, create 2 copies of each experiment. For one, mark the end of the experiment name with ba (before antibody); mark the other with aa (after antibody). Once all experiments have been entered close dialogue box. &lt;br/> 6. Turn on sufficient fluidics stations. Replace bottles of RNase free dH2O with the appropriate bottles of wash solutions and empty the waste bottle. &lt;br/> 7. Open Fluidics dialogue box of appropriate station and run Prime wash protocol on all ports. In fluidics station LCD window 'Remove vial will appear. Lift vial and needle up, an audible click will be heard and LCD window will display Load empty vial. Replace vial into sample holder. The port should start priming. &lt;br/> 8. Once priming has been completed the instruction to Remove vial will reappear. Lift vial and needle up as before. &lt;br/> 9. Proceed to desired wash and stain protocol. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> C.1 Test 3 GeneChip wash and stain &lt;br/> 05.03.02 &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1. The SAPE (streptavidin-phycoerythrin) is light sensitive. Do not expose it to light more than necessary, store in the dark at 4oC. For steps (3) and (4) prepare a master mix in an amber microfuge tube or a foil wrapped tube. Before addition, pulse-vortex for 30 seconds all reagents except for goat IgG and biotinylated antibody, these should me mixed by tapping thoroughly. Mix master mix thoroughly by tapping tube, spin briefly as necessary. Store aliquots on ice in a covered ice-tub. &lt;br/> 2. When loading GeneChip into scanner, step (9), ensure that only the green light is illuminated on the scanner. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Once hybridisation is completed, remove fragmented cRNA from array and return to original tube. Store at -80oC. &lt;br/> 2. Fill array with 100µl of Wash Buffer A. &lt;br/> 3. Prepare a master mix of SAPE stain solution.

 Labeling - cRNA preparation using phenol &lt;br/> These protocols are based on those provided by Affymetrix and include modifications from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, MIT, Boston and the CSC/IC Microarray Centre. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> A. First strand cDNA synthesis 5.11.01 &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> &lt;br/> 1.It is very important to start with good quality, clean, total RNA. Acceptable ratios for the absorbance of the total RNA at 260nm and 280nm are between 1.9 and 2.1. Ensure that the total RNA is diluted, so that the absorbances measured are in the linear range for the spectrophotometer. This is often between 0.1 and 0.4 absorbance units. &lt;br/> 2.For step (1) we recommend starting with 10µg total RNA per reaction tube. Do not start with less than 10µg total RNA per reaction. Carry out two reactions for each sample if you require more than 40µg of cRNA. &lt;br/> 3.Steps (3) and (4) are key to the preparation of cDNA. Step (3) breaks any secondary structures of the RNA while step (4) inhibits the reoccurrence of secondary structures. &lt;br/> 4.Make a 'master mix' for step (5). Mix thoroughly and spin briefly, as necessary. &lt;br/> 5.Use RNase free microfuge tubes and pipette tips throughout.&lt;br/>  &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Place the following in a microfuge tube: &lt;br/>  -µl (10µg) total RNA in nuclease free treated dH2O &lt;br/>  -µl (100 pmol) T7-(T)24 primer &lt;br/>  (GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(T)24) &lt;br/>  1µl Poly A+ Controls &lt;br/>  -µl nuclease free dH2O &lt;br/>  11 µl final volume &lt;br/> 2.Mix by pipetting, spin briefly as necessary. &lt;br/> 3.Incubate at 65-70oC for 10 minutes. &lt;br/> 4.Place tubes on ice. &lt;br/> 5.Prepare a master mix on ice. The quantities are for each reaction/tube: &lt;br/>  4µl (5x) First Strand Buffer (thaw at 37oC, put on ice), Invitrogen Y02321 &lt;br/>  2µl (0.1 M) DTT, Invitrogen Y00147 &lt;br/>  1µl (10mM) dNTPs, Invitrogen 18427-013 &lt;br/>  7µl &lt;br/>  Mix by pipetting, spin briefly as necessary.Add 7µl of master mix to each reaction tube.&lt;br/>  6.Incubate at 42 oC for 2 minutes. &lt;br/> 7.Add 2µl Superscript II reverse transcriptase (400 U total), Invitrogen 18064-014. &lt;br/> 8.Tap tube to mix, spin briefly as necessary. &lt;br/> 9.Incubate at 42oC for 1 hour in a waterbath. &lt;br/> 10.Place tube on ice and proceed to 'Second strand cDNA synthesis', or transfer tube to dry ice, allow reaction to freeze and store at -80oC. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> B. Second strand cDNA synthesis 12.02.01. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1.Check the units/µl for the RNase H, it is important that exactly 2U are used per reaction; you may have to adjust volumes accordingly. &lt;br/> 2.Make a 'master mix' for step (2). Mix thoroughly because the enzymes are in glycerol. Spin briefly, as necessary. &lt;br/> 3.For step (4), incubate either in a water bath in the cold room or in a refrigerated block with a lid, to reduce condensation. &lt;br/> 4.For step (5), store at -80oC only if you cannot go to the 'Clean-up of double stranded cDNA' step immediately after the second strand cDNA synthesis is completed. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1.Place all reagents and first strand reaction tubes on ice. Assemble master mix on ice. &lt;br/> 2.Prepare a master mix in a new microfuge tube. For each reaction use: &lt;br/>  -µl nuclease free treated dH2O &lt;br/>  30µl (5x) Second Strand Buffer, Invitrogen 10812-014&lt;br/>  3µl (10mM) dNTPs, Invitrogen 18427-013 &lt;br/>  1µl DNA Ligase (10 Units), Invitrogen 18052-019 &lt;br/>  4µl DNA Pol I (40 Units), Invitrogen 18010-025 &lt;br/>  -µl RNase H (2 Units), Invitrogen 18021-071 &lt;br/>  130µl &lt;br/>  Mix by vortexing, spin briefly as necessary. Add 130µl of the master mix to each of the first strand reaction tubes. &lt;br/> 3.Mix by pipetting, spin briefly as necessary.&lt;br/> 4.Incubate at 16oC for 2 hours. Use a water bath in a cold room or a refrigerated block with lid, if possible. This reduces condensation. &lt;br/> 5.Place tube on ice and proceed to 'Clean-up of double stranded cDNA', or transfer tube to dry ice, freeze and store at -80oC. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> C. Clean-up of double stranded cDNA 25.09.02. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1. Double stranded cRNA clean up is carried out using the GeneChipý Sample Cleanup Module, Affymetrix 900371. Prepare reagents following the instructions in the kit. &lt;br/> 2. Perform the clean up in a 1.5 or 2ml microfuge tube. &lt;br/> 3. Ensure ethanol has been added to cDNA Wash Buffer before use. &lt;br/> 4. After the clean up, ALL of the double stranded cDNA is used for the in vitro transcription reaction.

The dilution should be sufficient so that readings obtained are in the linear range for the spectrophotometer. Unless known otherwise assume this is between 0.1 and 0.4 absorbance units (try preparing a serial dilution, diluting 2µl of eluate in 48µl of dH2O and then this 50µl in 450µl of dH2O). The cRNA should be clean e.g. a ratio of the absorbances at 260nm to 280nm should be around 2.0, with an acceptable range of 1.9 to 2.1. You should have 40 to 110µg of cRNA (assuming that you started with 10µg total RNA where 1 OD260 unit is equivalent to 40µg/ml single stranded RNA). If you have a yield of less than 40µg of cRNA per reaction (per 10µg reaction of total RNA), we recommend that you do not use the cRNA, as there is likely to be a problem with sample preparation. &lt;br/> 22.Run a sample of the total RNA and cRNA for each sample (500ng to 1µg) on a denaturing 1% agarose gel along with a marker spanning 200bp to 3kb (a DNA marker gives a rough idea of the size). The cRNA product should be a smear from about 100bp to 2kb with a brighter region from 500bp to 1kb, there is an example image for guidance at the end of this protocol. Photograph the gel, so that the markers are easy to identify and label the lanes with the sample identifier. &lt;br/> 23.Freeze by placing tube on dry ice and store at 80 °C. &lt;br/> 24.Bring the cRNA to the Microarray Centre on dry ice (after prior consultation with Helen Banks or Nicola Cooley to arrange a convenient time). Note that each sample should be clearly labelled on both the top and side of each tube with the date (day, month, year e.g. 05.11.01) and the sample identifier. &lt;br/> In order to assess the quality of the cRNA samples, prior to hybridisation on test arrays, we also require the following information, for both the cRNA samples and the total RNA from which it was generated. &lt;br/>   (a) the raw absorbance readings &lt;br/>   (b) the ratio of the absorbances at 260nm and 280nm. &lt;br/>   (c) the cRNA yield from 10µg of total RNA. &lt;br/>   (d) an original photograph of the gel, with the markers and samples labelled.&lt;br/>  
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - TOTAL RNA EXTRACTION FROM TISSUES &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Homogenize tissue samples in mortar with excess amount of liquid nitrogen. Measure the weight of homogenized samples.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Transfer 50-100 mg of tissues in 50ml tube having 3 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Homogenize the samples using Tekmars TISSUMIZER or Polytron or equivalent. Always keep the tube in ice so as to prevent the overheating.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Optional Step: Additional step may be required for samples with high content of proteins, fat, polysaccharides or extra cellular materials such as muscles, fat tissue and tuberous parts of the plants. Following homogenisation, remove insoluble materials by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 minutes at 2-4 .C. The resulting pellet contains insoluble materials and the supernatant contains RNA. In samples from fat tissue, an excess of fat collects as a top layer, which should be removed. Transfer the clear homogenate solution in a fresh tube.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Phase Separation: Incubate the sample at 15 to 30 .C (RT) for 5 minutes to permit for the complete dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes. Add 0.2 ml of chloroform (high grade) per 1 ml of TRIzol reagent.  Shake tubes vigorously for 15 seconds and incubate them at 15 to 30 .C (RT) for 2 to 3 minutes. Centrifuge the samples at 12000 g for 15 mints at 2 to 4.C. Following centrifugation; the mixture separates into a lower red, phenol-chloroform phase, an interphase, and a colourless upper aqueous phase. RNA remains exclusively in the aqueous phase. The volume of the aqueous phase is about 60% of the volume of TRIzol used for homogenisation.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> RNA Precipitation: Transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh tube and save the organic phase if isolation of DNA or protein is desired. Precipitate RNA from the aqueous phase by mixing with isopropyl alcohol. Use 0.5 ml of Isopropyl alcohol for every 1ml of TRIzol used. Incubate samples at 15 to 30 .C for 10 minutes and centrifuge at 12000g for 10 minutes at 2-4.C.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> Remove the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet. Wash the RNA pellet once with 75% alcohol, adding at least 1ml of 75% ethanol for every 1 ml of TRIzol used. Mix the sample by vortexing slowly and centrifuge at 7500 g for 5 minutes at 2-4.C. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Remove the supernatant carefully without disturbing the pellet. Dry the RNA pellet in air for 10 minutes. Dissolve the RNA pellet in 100 ul of RNase free water. Pipette out few times and transfer in eppendorf tube and store in 70.C. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>                Total RNA is further cleaned up by using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) Cat No:74104 &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Step 1: 350ul of RLT buffer is required for each total RNA sample. Take the aliquot required in a tube (If you are going to clean 10 samples, calculate for 12 samples and take 12*350= 4.2 ml) and add 10ul of B-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Molecular Biology Grade) per 1ml of RLT buffer (42ul for 4.2 ml of RLT buffer).&lt;br/> Step 2: Add 350 of RLT Buffer (B-Mercaptoethanol added) to 100ul of total RNA sample (if the volume is less make up to 100ul) and mix thoroughly. Add 250ul of 100% ethanol. Mix well by pipetting. Do not centrifuge.&lt;br/> Step 3: Apply sample (Should be around 700ul) to an RNeasy mini spin column, sitting in a collection tube. Centrifuge in cold for 20 sec at 8000g. You can apply the flow through in the column for twice to improve the yield. Discard the flow through as well the tube after repeating step 3 twice. Keep the column in a fresh 2ml tube.&lt;br/> Step 4: Apply 500ul of RPE buffer (please make sure that alcohol is added in RPE buffer) on to the column. Centrifuge for 15 sec at 8000g. Discard the flow through.&lt;br/> Step 5: Apply 500ul of RPE buffer and centrifuge for 2 min at max speed. Discard the flow through. Spin again at max speed for a minute. Transfer the column in a fresh RNase free collection tube. &lt;br/> Step 6: Pipette 30ul of RNase free water on to the column. Heat the sample at 55.C for not more than 2 minutes (to get maximum yield). Centrifuge at 8000g for a minute. Repeat step 6 once more  to get 60ul of clean total RNA and proceed with QC and OD measurements. It is always to better keep the stock in two-three aliquots (to avoid freeze-thaw cycle) before freezing them in dry ice and transfer them to -80.&lt;br/> &lt;br/></field>

 Nucleic Acid Extraction - RNA ISOLATION with TRIzol Reagent 1. Caution : When working with Trizol Reagent use gloves and eye protection. Avoid contact with skin or clothing. Use in a chemical hood.TRIzol is toxic in contact with skin and if swallowed. Causes burns. After contact with skin, wash immediately with plenty of detergent and water. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice. Contains Phenol and other components. 2. Material and reagents required : - Dry ice - Liquid nitrogen - Chloroform - Isopropanol - 75 % Ethanol (in DEPC-water) - RNase-free water : Add 100 µl DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) to 100 ml nanopure water. Let stand overnight and autoclave. - RNase-free tips, eppendorf-tubes (2 ml and 1.5 ml),... - TRIzol reagent 3. Precautions for preventing RNase contamination : - Always wear gloves. Skin often contains bacteria and molds that can contaminate a RNA preparation and be a source of RNases. - Use a new bag of tips or a bag with tips only used for RNA-work. - Use gloves to fill boxes with tips. - Use sterile, disposable plasticware reserved for RNA work to prevent cross-contamination with RNases from shared equipment. - Always use DEPC-treated water during the preparation. 4.METHOD : 4.1. Grinding of the plant tissue : Grind the plant tissue under liquid nitrogen to a fine powder (in an 2 ml eppendorf-tube). Allow the liquid nitrogen to evaporate. Do not allow the sample to thaw (Keep the samples on dry ice !). Note : Incomplete grinding of the starting material will lead to reduced RNA yield. 4.2. Homogenization of the plant tissue : Homogenize tissue samples in 1 ml TRIzol Reagent (per 50-100 mg of tissue). Add the trizol in 2 times: at first add 200 and grind the tissue in the solution, and then add 800 ml. Mix the sample by vortexing until the tissue is dissolved. From now on you can work at room temperature ! Incubate the homogenized samples for 5 minutes at room temperature. 4.3. Phase separation : Add 200 µl chloroform per 1 ml TRIzol Reagent. Cap the tubes securely and shake by hand for 15 seconds. Incubate at room temperature for 2 - 3 minutes. Centrifuge the samples for 15 minutes at 11 000 rpm at 4 °C. 4.4. RNA precipitation Transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh Rnase- free tube. Add 500 µl isopropanol per 1 ml TRIzol Reagent. Incubate the samples for 10 minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 11000 rpm and at 4 °C. 4.5. RNA wash Remove the supernatant. Wash the RNA pellet with 1 ml of 75 % ethanol per 1 ml TRIzol Reagent. Centrifuge the sample for 5 minutes at 11 000 rpm and at 4 °C. Dry the pellet for 10 minutes at room temperature (air-dry). 4.6.Redissolving the RNA Add 40 µl DEPC-water. Incubate the samples for 10 minutes at 65 °C in a thermoblock. Leave the samples on ice for overnight (at 4 °C) (or shorter). Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 11 000 rpm. Carefully remove the supernatant to a new Rnase-free tube. Mesure the concentration with the spectro-fotometer (OD 260 / 280) or check 2 µl RNA on an agarosegel (1.2 % agarose/ 0.5 x TBE buffer prepared with DEPC-H2O).</field>

 Labeling - The SuperScript? Indirect cDNA Labeling System is a highly efficient system for generating fluorescently labeled cDNA for use on microarrays in gene expression studies (De Risi et al., 1996; Eisen &amp; Brown, 1999). It uses an aminoallyl-modified nucleotide and an aminohexyl-modified nucleotide together with other dNTPs in a cDNA synthesis reaction with SuperScript? III Reverse Transcriptase. After a purification step to remove unincorporated nucleotides, the amino-modified cDNA is coupled with a monoreactive, N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-ester fluorescent dye. A final purification step removes any unreacted dye, and the fluorescently labeled cDNA is ready for hybridization to microarrays.  This system uses 5?20 ?g of total RNA or 0.4?2 ?g of mRNA as starting material, and is compatible with Alexa Fluor? 555 and Alexa Fluor? 647 fluorescent dyes from Invitrogen, Cy3? and Cy5? dyes from Amersham Biosciences, or other monoreactive NHS-ester dyes from a variety of manufacturers. 
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was extracted in three steps 1. Modefied Phenol chloroform extraction (TRIZOL, Invitrogen, USA) were The upper aqueous phase was precipitated in 25% isopropanol and 25% RNA precipitation solution described by Chomczynski and Mackey 1995 (Biotechniques 19:942-945).  2.

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - For the seedling samples, seeds were surface-sterilized and then spread on Petri dishes containing B-5 medium (Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands) solidified with 0.8% phytagar (Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands). The seeds were cold-treated for 3 days at 4°C to ensure uniform germination. The plates were transferred to short-day conditions (8 h of light at 21°C-23°C) and grown in a horizontal position for 7 days. Per seedling sample more than 25 seedlings from five Petri dishes were collected after 7 days of growth.
 Sample Processing - Samples were collected and transferred directly to liquid nitrogen and the tissues/cells were grinded to a fine powder using mortar and pestle.

 Labeling - Total RNA from sperm cells, pollen and seedlings was extracted using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Germany).  RNA integrity was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser with a RNA 6000 Nano Assay (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). RNA was processed for use on Affymetrix Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays (Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers Two-Cycle Target Labeling Assay. Briefly, 16 ng of total RNA containing spiked-in Poly-A RNA controls (GeneChip Expression GeneChip Eukaryotic Poly-A RNA Control Kit; Affymetrix) was used in a reverse transcription reaction (Two-Cycle DNA synthesis kit; Affymetrix) to generate first-strand cDNA. After second-strand synthesis, double-stranded cDNA was used in an in vitro transcription (IVT) reaction to generate cRNA (MEGAscript T7 kit; Ambion, Austin, TX). The cRNA obtained was used for a second round of cDNA and cRNA synthesis, resulting in biotinylated cRNA (GeneChip Expression 3-Amplification Reagents for IVT-Labeling; Affymetrix). The size distribution of the cRNA and fragmented cRNA, respectively, was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with a RNA 6000 Nano Assay. Fifteen micrograms of fragmented cRNA was used in a 300-µl hybridization containing added hybridization controls. 200 µl of the mixture was hybridized on arrays for 16 h at 45°C. Standard post-hybridization washes and double-stain protocols (FS450_0004) were used on an Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450, in conjunction with the GeneChip Hybridization Wash and Stain kit (Affymetrix). Arrays were scanned on an Affymetrix GeneChip scanner 3000 7G.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)according to the manufacturers protocol.

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - For Col 0 wildtype (NASC N1092), or mutants npr1-1 (NASC N3726) or sid2 (unavailable at NASC), seeds were grown on soil in 2.5 inch pots under 8h of 100uE/m/s warm light (get reference) after a 3 day vernalization treatment at 4C.  The temperature and humidity were maintained between 20-23oC and 55-65% respectively.  The plant trays were covered with a plastic lid until the cotyledons emerged, after which the lid was removed.  The plants were watered from below 2x a week with fertilizer at 0.5ml/1.5 L (get reference). For coi1-1 mutants, the seeds were sterilized in a solution of 5% bleach and 0.2 ul/ml Triton x-100 for 5 min and rinsed thoroughly with sterilized water. The seeds were suspended in 0.15% agar and sown on the MS agar plates (1/2x Murashige and Skoog medium (micro and macro elements), 1-2 g/L sucrose). After a 3 day incubation at 4C, the Petri dishes were placed in the growth room under the same conditions as the plants.  The plants were transferred to soil after 7days of growth and watered by the same method as other plants.  All plants used in experiments were grown for 6 weeks under this short-day regime.
 Hybridization - CATMA reflective slides (CATMAv2.3 or CATMAv2.4, 23K, printed by VIB) were humidified by holding the array over near boiling water for 1-2 min and then letting them dry flat. The slides were x-linked at 50 mJ and then immediately pretreated for 30-60 min with 2x SSPE/0.2%SDS at room temperature, protected from light. The slides were rinsed by being dipped a few times in distilled water at RT and immediately dried by centrifugation. The slide was placed in a TeleChem manual hybridization cassette with a 25x60 LifterSlip coverslip and 15 ul of 3x SSC for each groove. The probe was diluted to a final volume of 90uL as follows: cDNA (combination of 40 pmol ± 5 pmol of Cy5-labeled cDNA and 40 pmol± 5 pmol of Cy3-labeled cDNA); yeast tRNA (0.2ug/ul final volume); 3% SSC; 0.38% SDS; 50% formamide. The probe mixture was boiled for 1 min, and centrifuged for 1 min. The probe was added to the microarray chip as quickly as possible, using capillary action to cover the area under the 25x60 lifterslip. The microarray cassette was sealed and submerged in a covered 42oC water bath for approximately 16 h. The slide was washed for 10 min in 1xSSC, 0.2% SDS (55oC) (coverslip was removed in first wash solution); 10 min in 0.1x SSC, 0.2% SDS (55oC); 10 min in 0.1x SSC, 0.2% SDS (55oC); 1 min in 0.1x SSC (37oC); and 1 min in 0.1x SSC (25oC) then dried immediately by centrifugation (2 min at 2600 rpm). It was stored in a dark container and scanned as soon as possible.
 Labeling - 5 ug of aRNA and 1 ul reference (green) spike mix (Amersham, Lucidea Universal ScoreCard, 63-0042-87), 1 ug of random nonamers (2ug/ul 9N, Microsynth), were heated at 70°C for 10 min then chilled on ice. The following ingredients were added: 4 ul First Strand Buffer, 2 ul 0.1M DTT, 1 ul of 10 mM dATP, 10 mM dGTP, 10 mM dTTP/2mM dCTP, 2ul Cy3-dCTP  depending on the sample or the dyeswap, 0.5 ul (10 units) of RNase Inhibitor (Invitrogen, 155 18-012), and 1.5 ul (300 units) SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, 180 64-014) for a final volume of 20 ul. The reaction was incubated for 2 hours at 42°C before the RNA template was denatured with 2 ul 1M NaOH at 65°C for 10 min. The solution was immediately neutralized by adding 2 ul 1 M HCl plus 2 ul 3M NaAc pH 5.2 to assure an acidic pH for purification. The labeled cDNA was purified using a MinElute column (Qiagen, 28004). Manufacturers instructions were followed for the purification except the cDNA was eluted twice with 10 ul of the EB solution.  The incorporation of the dyes was monitored using a Nanodrop spectrometer.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - The frozen plant tissue was quickly ground to a fine powder using a mortar chilled in liquid nitrogen. The frozen powder was carefully transferred into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes (~100 mg/tube) using small funnels and rubber spatulas also cooled with liquid nitrogen, . The frozen tissue was homogenized in 1 mL of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, 15596-026) then incubated at room temperature for at least 5 min with agitation. Chloroform (200 ul) was added to each sample and the tubes were vortexed or forcefully shaken by hand for 15 sec. After 2-3 min of incubation at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 4°C at 12000xg. The aqueous layer was transferred to a new 1.5 mL tube and 500 ul of isopropanol was added. The mixture was gently inverted to mix and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before centrifuging at 12000xg, 4°C, for 10 min. The pellet was washed with 75% ethanol (in DEPC-H2O) and centrifuged for 5 min at 12000xg and 4°C. The pellet was air-dried for 5 min at room temperature then resuspended for purification.  The total RNA was purified by NH4Ac precipitation was achieved by resuspending the pellet in 75 ul of water, and adding 7.5 ul of 5M NH4Ac from Ambion plus 210 ul of 100% ethanol.  The mixture was placed at -20C or -80C for at least one hour then centrifuged at 12000xg for 15min at 4C.  The supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed in cold 70% ethanol.  The samples were centrifuged at 12000xg for 5 min at 4C then all supernatant was removed. The pellet was air-dried and resuspended in DEPC-water to have a 1ug/ul concentration. The RNA was quantified by spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Witec). Of this total RNA, 2.5 ug was amplified via the aRNA MessageAmp kit (Ambion, 1750) or 1 ug using aRNA MessageAmp II (Ambion, 1751) using according to manufacturers instructions. All reactions were performed at ? volumes which were brought up to the full requested volumes for the purifications with water. Any necessary volume reductions were achieved using a speedvac.</field>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Hybridization - Hybridisation and Staining Protocols &lt;br/> These are the protocols used by the Microarray Centre to process labelled cRNA for GeneChip experiments, There are several protocols which can be used and their use is determined by the state of the cRNA and the type of chip being used. &lt;br/> &lt;br/>  1.Hybridisation of fragmented cRNA to GeneChip &lt;br/>  2.Preparation of GeneChip Station &lt;br/>  3.Either: a. Test 3 Processing b. Genome scale array processing &lt;br/>  4.Shutdown of GeneChip Station &lt;br/> &lt;br/> A. Hybridisation of fragmented cRNA to GeneChip &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1. There are two septa on the back of the GeneChip. Whilst filling or emptying the hybridisation chamber through one septum, a pipette tip must be inserted into the other as a vent. &lt;br/> 2. The more you inset/remove tips into the septa, the looser they will become. Eventually they will start to leak. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1. Equilibrate array at room temperature for 30 minutes before use. &lt;br/> 2. Heat frozen fragmented cRNA at 99oC for 5 minutes. &lt;br/> 3.

 Labeling - cRNA preparation using phenol &lt;br/> These protocols are based on those provided by Affymetrix and include modifications from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, MIT, Boston and the CSC/IC Microarray Centre. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> A. First strand cDNA synthesis 5.11.01 &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> &lt;br/> 1.It is very important to start with good quality, clean, total RNA. Acceptable ratios for the absorbance of the total RNA at 260nm and 280nm are between 1.9 and 2.1. Ensure that the total RNA is diluted, so that the absorbances measured are in the linear range for the spectrophotometer. This is often between 0.1 and 0.4 absorbance units. &lt;br/> 2.For step (1) we recommend starting with 10µg total RNA per reaction tube. Do not start with less than 10µg total RNA per reaction. Carry out two reactions for each sample if you require more than 40µg of cRNA. &lt;br/> 3.Steps (3) and (4) are key to the preparation of cDNA. Step (3) breaks any secondary structures of the RNA while step (4) inhibits the reoccurrence of secondary structures. &lt;br/> 4.Make a 'master mix' for step (5). Mix thoroughly and spin briefly, as necessary. &lt;br/> 5.Use RNase free microfuge tubes and pipette tips throughout.&lt;br/>  &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1.

The quantities are for each reaction/tube: &lt;br/>  4µl (5x) First Strand Buffer (thaw at 37oC, put on ice), Invitrogen Y02321 &lt;br/>  2µl (0.1 M) DTT, Invitrogen Y00147 &lt;br/>  1µl (10mM) dNTPs, Invitrogen 18427-013 &lt;br/>  7µl &lt;br/>  Mix by pipetting, spin briefly as necessary.Add 7µl of master mix to each reaction tube.&lt;br/>  6.Incubate at 42 oC for 2 minutes. &lt;br/> 7.Add 2µl Superscript II reverse transcriptase (400 U total), Invitrogen 18064-014. &lt;br/> 8.Tap tube to mix, spin briefly as necessary. &lt;br/> 9.Incubate at 42oC for 1 hour in a waterbath. &lt;br/> 10.Place tube on ice and proceed to 'Second strand cDNA synthesis', or transfer tube to dry ice, allow reaction to freeze and store at -80oC. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> B. Second strand cDNA synthesis 12.02.01. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1.Check the units/µl for the RNase H, it is important that exactly 2U are used per reaction; you may have to adjust volumes accordingly. &lt;br/> 2.Make a 'master mix' for step (2). Mix thoroughly because the enzymes are in glycerol. Spin briefly, as necessary. &lt;br/> 3.For step (4), incubate either in a water bath in the cold room or in a refrigerated block with a lid, to reduce condensation. &lt;br/> 4.For step (5), store at -80oC only if you cannot go to the 'Clean-up of double stranded cDNA' step immediately after the second strand cDNA synthesis is completed. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method &lt;br/> 1.Place all reagents and first strand reaction tubes on ice. Assemble master mix on ice. &lt;br/> 2.Prepare a master mix in a new microfuge tube. For each reaction use: &lt;br/>  -µl nuclease free treated dH2O &lt;br/>  30µl (5x) Second Strand Buffer, Invitrogen 10812-014&lt;br/>  3µl (10mM) dNTPs, Invitrogen 18427-013 &lt;br/>  1µl DNA Ligase (10 Units), Invitrogen 18052-019 &lt;br/>  4µl DNA Pol I (40 Units), Invitrogen 18010-025 &lt;br/>  -µl RNase H (2 Units), Invitrogen 18021-071 &lt;br/>  130µl &lt;br/>  Mix by vortexing, spin briefly as necessary. Add 130µl of the master mix to each of the first strand reaction tubes. &lt;br/> 3.Mix by pipetting, spin briefly as necessary.&lt;br/> 4.Incubate at 16oC for 2 hours. Use a water bath in a cold room or a refrigerated block with lid, if possible. This reduces condensation. &lt;br/> 5.Place tube on ice and proceed to 'Clean-up of double stranded cDNA', or transfer tube to dry ice, freeze and store at -80oC. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> C. Clean-up of double stranded cDNA 25.09.02. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1. Double stranded cRNA clean up is carried out using the GeneChipý Sample Cleanup Module, Affymetrix 900371. Prepare reagents following the instructions in the kit. &lt;br/> 2. Perform the clean up in a 1.5 or 2ml microfuge tube. &lt;br/> 3. Ensure ethanol has been added to cDNA Wash Buffer before use. &lt;br/> 4. After the clean up, ALL of the double stranded cDNA is used for the in vitro transcription reaction.

Gently mix the reaction every hour by tapping tube, spin briefly as necessary. &lt;br/&gt; 5.Proceed to 'Clean-up of cRNA', or freeze by placing tube on dry ice and store at -80oC.&lt;br/> &lt;br/> E. Clean-up of cRNA 07.03.03. &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Things to note: &lt;br/> 1.Removal of unincorporated biotinylated ribonucleotides is very important &lt;br/> obtaining a good quality scan.&lt;br/> 2. cRNA clean up is carried out using the GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module,Affymetrix 900371. Prepare reagents following the instructions in the kit.&lt;br/> 3. Ensure ethanol has been added to IVT cRNA Wash Buffer before use. &lt;br/> 4. Be careful not to touch the tip of the spin column at any time. &lt;br/> 5. Carry out centrifugation at >= 8,000g (>= 10,000rpm). &lt;br/> &lt;br/> Method: &lt;br/>  1.Add to the in vitro transcription reaction tubes: &lt;br/>  60µl nuclease free dH2O &lt;br/>  350µl IVT cRNA Binding Buffer &lt;br/> 2.Mix thoroughly by pipetting. &lt;br/> 3.Add 250µl (100%) ethanol. Mix by pipetting. Do not spin. &lt;br/> 4.Apply sample to an IVT cRNA Cleanup Spin Column. &lt;br/> 5.Spin at >= 8,000g (>= 10,000rpm) for 15 seconds. &lt;br/> 6.Transfer the spin column to a fresh 2ml collection tube.&lt;br/>  7.Add 500µl IVT cRNA Wash Buffer onto the spin column. &lt;br/> 8.Spin at >= 8,000g (>= 10,000rpm) for 15 seconds. &lt;br/> 9.Empty the collection tube. &lt;br/> 10.Add 500µl (80%) ethanol onto the spin column. &lt;br/> 11.Spin at >= 8,000g (>= 10,000rpm) for 15 seconds. &lt;br/> 12.Empty the collection tube. &lt;br/> 13.Open the cap of the spin column and centrifuge at maximum speed for 5 minutes to completely dry the membrane. &lt;br/> 14.Transfer spin column into a new 1.5ml Collection tube. &lt;br/> 15.Elute by placing 11µl of RNase-free water directly onto the middle of the spin column membrane. &lt;br/> 16.Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes. &lt;br/> 17.Spin at maximum speed for 1 minute. &lt;br/> 18.Add 10µl of RNase-free water directly onto the middle of the spin column membrane. &lt;br/> 19.Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes.&lt;br/>  20.Spin at maximum speed for 1 minute. &lt;br/> 21.Dilute an aliquot of the eluate with dH2O (not DEPC treated) and measure the absorbance at 260nm and 280nm. The dilution should be sufficient so that readings obtained are in the linear range for the spectrophotometer. Unless known otherwise assume this is between 0.1 and 0.4 absorbance units (try preparing a serial dilution, diluting 2µl of eluate in 48µl of dH2O and then this 50µl in 450µl of dH2O). The cRNA should be clean e.g. a ratio of the absorbances at 260nm to 280nm should be around 2.0, with an acceptable range of 1.9 to 2.1. You should have 40 to 110µg of cRNA (assuming that you started with 10µg total RNA where 1 OD260 unit is equivalent to 40µg/ml single stranded RNA). If you have a yield of less than 40µg of cRNA per reaction (per 10µg reaction of total RNA), we recommend that you do not use the cRNA, as there is likely to be a problem with sample preparation. &lt;br/> 22.Run a sample of the total RNA and cRNA for each sample (500ng to 1µg) on a denaturing 1% agarose gel along with a marker spanning 200bp to 3kb (a DNA marker gives a rough idea of the size). The cRNA product should be a smear from about 100bp to 2kb with a brighter region from 500bp to 1kb, there is an example image for guidance at the end of this protocol. Photograph the gel, so that the markers are easy to identify and label the lanes with the sample identifier. &lt;br/> 23.Freeze by placing tube on dry ice and store at 80 °C. &lt;br/> 24.Bring the cRNA to the Microarray Centre on dry ice (after prior consultation with Helen Banks or Nicola Cooley to arrange a convenient time). Note that each sample should be clearly labelled on both the top and side of each tube with the date (day, month, year e.g. 05.11.01) and the sample identifier. &lt;br/> In order to assess the quality of the cRNA samples, prior to hybridisation on test arrays, we also require the following information, for both the cRNA samples and the total RNA from which it was generated. &lt;br/>   (a) the raw absorbance readings &lt;br/>   (b) the ratio of the absorbances at 260nm and 280nm. &lt;br/>   (c) the cRNA yield from 10µg of total RNA. &lt;br/>   (d) an original photograph of the gel, with the markers and samples labelled.&lt;br/></field>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 grown on agar (0.5g/L MES pH6.0, 0.1% sucrose, 0.5x MS salts, 6g/L Lab M agar) at 20oC, 65% humidity to growth stage 1.04 (Boyes scale).  Light was cool white light at 100 uEm-2s-1, 16 hour day cycle. Harvest occurred between 6-8h into the 16h day.  The roots were cut off and the whole shoot was immediately frozen in 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tubes using liquid nitrogen.  
 Sample Processing - Plants were grown to specified stage without external treatment.
 Hybridization - Catma reflective slides are pretreated for 30min with 2x SSPE/0.2%SDS at room temperature.  They are dipped a couple of times in distilled water at RT and immediately dried by centrifugation. The slide was placed in a chamber with a 25x60 lifterslip and 13ul of 3x SSC for each groove.  The probe was diluted to a final volume of 100 uL as follows: 9ul of purified, labeled cDNA; 6 ul of dH2O; 10 ul of Yeast tRNA (2ug/uL); 25 ul of Amersham Microarray Hybridization Buffer; 50 uL formamide.  The probe mixture is heated for 3 min at 95oC, put on ice for 30 sec and centrifuged to remove dust for 1 min.  The chamber (with the chip) and the probe mixture are preheated for 2-3 min at 42oC then added to the chip at quickly as possible.  The microarray is sealed in a chamber and submerged in a 42oC water bath for approximately 16 h. The microarray is washed for 4 min in 1xSSC, 0.2% SDS (42oC); 4 min in 0.1x SSC, 0.2% SDS (RT); 4 min in 0.1x SSC, 0.2% SDS (RT); 4 min in 0.1x SSC(RT); and 4 min in 0.1x SSC(RT) then dried immediately by centrifugation (2min at 2600rpm)
 Labeling - 2 ug of aRNA is primed with random nonamers and labelled with 3ul of Cy3-CTP (Amersham 25nmol tube, PA55321).  
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Plant tissue was ground to fine powder using liquid nitrogen in a 2mL eppendorf tube. The sample was homogenized in 1 mL TRIzol Reagent by vortexing and incubated at room temperature for 5 min.  Chloroform (200ul/1mL TRIzol) was added and the capped tubes were hand-shaken for 15 sec. They were incubated for 2-3 min, then centrifuged for 15 min at 11000rpm at 4oC.  The aqueous phase was transferred to a new 1.5 mL tube and 500ul of isopropanol was added.  The samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature then centrifuged for 10 min at 11000 rpm at 4oC.  The supernatent was removed and the pellet was washed with 1 mL of 75% ethanol in DEPC-treated water.  The samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 11000 rpm at 4oC.  The pellet was air-dried for 10 min at room-temperature.  The pellet was resuspended in 40 ul DEPC-treated water, incubated at 65oC for 10 min, and left on ice overnight at 4oC.  They were centrifuged at 11000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatent was transferred to a new tube.  Quality assessment was performed by spectrophotometer at OD 260 and OD 280.  5 ug of total RNA was amplified to aRNA using the Ambion MessageAmp Kit (ambion, #1750).</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Image Adquisition - Separate images were acquired for each dye at a resolution of 10 µm per pixel. Intensities of the fluorescent signals were quantified using Imagene 4.2 (BioDiscovery, Inc.).  The signals were focused using a row of spots within the middle of the array and normalized such that the Cy3 and Cy5 channels are matched at similar signal intensities as high as possible but avoiding a large percentage of saturated signals over the entire array.  The laser and PMT settings were adjusted to each channel individually such that the laser setting controlled the signal intensity and the PMT was set 5% higher.  The quantification of the spot intensities was performed by the Imagene 4.2 (BioDiscovery, Inc) program.  The grid spots were adjusted to the array spot by the program find spots algorithm for consistency.</field>

      <name>Transcription profiling of Foxa2 knock-outs in mice to better define the role of this gene in glucose homeostasis</name>
      <description>Study to further characterize the genetic and functional consequence of the beta cell-specific ablation of Foxa2 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 beta, HNF-3b) in mice to better define the role of this gene in glucose homeostasis. The study involved 8 two-channel assays on UPenn Mouse PancChip 4.0, each consisting of a competitive mutant vs control hybridization. 4 control and 4 Foxa2loxP/loxP;Ins.CRE RNA samples were hybridized to the array using a dye-swap design. (The results from one of these assays had to be discarded from the analyses, so 7 assays were used.)</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of mouse pancreatic duct cell lines infected with Ngn3-expressing adenovirus</name>
      <description>We have developed an in vitro model of Ngn3-dependent differentiation by infecting pancreatic duct cell lines with an Ngn3-expressing adenovirus. We used glass microarrays containing 18,000 mouse cDNAs and compared gene expression patterns in mPAC L20 cells infected with either AdCMV-gal (control) or AdCMV-ngn3. All comparisons were performed 48 h after viral infection, meaning that genes differentially expressed in Ngn3-expressing mPAC cells could include genes whose expression was directly or indirectly controlled by Ngn3.</description>

 Hybridization - Purified, labeled cDNA was resuspended in 11 B5l of 3C SSC containing 0.75mg/ml polydA (Amersham ref: 27-4110-01), 25mM hepes and 0.23 % SDS.  Before hybridization, the solution was boiled for 2 min and then allowed to cool to room temperature.  The solution was applied to the microarray under a cover slip, and the slide was placed in a custom hybridization chamber which was subsequently incubated for 12 to 16 hours in a water bath at 63B0C.  Before scanning, slides were washed in 0.6C SSC, 0.02% SDS for 1 min, and then 0.05C SSC for 1 min.  Slides were dried before scanning by centrifugation at 500 rpm in a Beckman CS-6R centrifuge.
 Labeling - 10 ug of total RNA was primed by 5 ug of a dT(16) oligomer and the mixture was heated to 70C for 10 min, and then transferred to ice. A premixed solution, consisting of 200 U Superscript II (Gibco), buffer, 100mM DTT 0.5mM dNTP, was added to the RNA. The reaction was then incubated at 42C for 2 hours. Nucleotides were used at these final concentrations: 0.5 mM for dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 0.1 mM for dTTP and 0.4mM for aminoallyl-dUTP (Sigma ref: A0410).  NaOH and EDTA were then added and RNA was hydrolyzed by incubation at 65C for 15min. After neutralization using Hepes, the aminoallyl cDNA was purified using a Bio-spin6 column (BioRad, ref: 732-6002) and concentrated using Centricon-30 microconcentrators (Amicon, ref 42410). NaHCO3 pH9 was added to a final concentration of 0.05M and each cDNA was combined with an aliquot of Cy3 or Cy5 monofunctional dye ester (Amersham, ref: PA25001/2) and incubated for an hour of coupling in the dark. Dye-coupled cDNA was purified using Qiaquick column (Qiagen ref: UB300) and concentrated with a Centricon-30 microconcentrator.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Adherent cells were rinsed with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), and cells were scraped off the plates and lyzed using the buffer RLT of the RNA isolation Kit from Qiagen (RNeasy). RNA was isolated following manufacturer's protocol including an optional DNAse treatment using the RNAse free DNAse kit from Qiagen.</field>

      <name>Transcription profiling of wild type and foxA1 null mice</name>
      <description>The aim of this experiment was to use microarray analysis to examine the phenotype of the foxA1 (HNF3alpha) null mouse. foxA1 has a central role in the regulatory control of islet genes essential for glucose homeostasis in vivo.  Previous studies have shown that the foxA1 null mouse demonstrates severe postnatal growth retardation followed by death between P2 and P12. These mutant mice are hypoglycemic despite unchanged expression of foxA1 target genes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis. foxA1 is known to bind to and transactivate the proglucagon gene promoter and mice null for this gene have a 70% reduction in pancreatic proglucagon gene expression and plasma glucagon levels are reduced markedly.  Marco Vatamaniuk from Klaus Kaestner Lab extracted RNA from isolated islets.  Three biological replicates were provided for both the WT and Null.</description>

      <description>This experiment was designed to study the effects of lipid culture on INS-1 derived glucose-responsive 832/13 cells.  After 48-hr culture with lipids, a dramatic decrease in glucose-responsiveness is observed.  In order to detect some earlier changes, RNA was also collected at earlier time points (12 hr and 24 hr).   To compensate for any changes associated with cell density, control cells (1%BSA culture) were included for each time point.  RNA was prepared from INS-1 cells in Dr. Chris Newgard's lab, quantified and sent frozen in water. Six biological replicates were sent for the following conditions: (i) 1%BSA (12, 24, and 48 hours) (ii) 1mM-Oleate/Palmitate (12, 24, and 48 hours).</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of wild type and C/EBPbeta deficient mice during a partial hepatectomy time series to identify transcriptional targets of C/EBPbeta</name>
      <description>The aim of this experiment was to use microarray analysis to compare the response of wild type (WT) and C/EBPbeta deficient (KO) mice during a partial hepatectomy time course in hopes of identifying transcriptional targets of C/EBPbeta. In addition, the WT time course alone was examined to analyze mammalian cellular proliferation in vivo.  In the partial hepatectomy model, quiescent hepatocytes reenter the cell cycle and progress in a synchronous fashion.  This allows for the elucidation of regulatory networks operative in mammalian cell cycle.

      <name>Transcription profiling of wild type and Foxa2 knock out mouse mature beta cells</name>
      <description>The winged helix transcription factor Foxa2 regulates Pdx1 gene expression and fetal endocrine pancreas development. We show here by inducible gene ablation that Foxa2 inactivation in mature beta-cells induces hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in Foxa2loxP/loxP, Pdx1-CreERT2 adult mice. Mutant beta-cells exhibited a markedly increased pool of docked insulin granules, some of which were engaged in sequential or compound exocytosis, consistent with an increased first phase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Expression of multiple genes involved in vesicular trafficking, membrane targeting and fuel-secretion pathways is dependent on Foxa2. In addition, impaired cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations and elevated intracellular cAMP production accompanied this secretory defect, and were likely contributors to the sensitization of the exocytotic machinery. Thus, in the absence of Foxa2, alterations in intracellular second messenger signaling redistribute the insulin granules into the readily releasable pool. We conclude that Foxa2 is required both for the fetal pancreas development and for the function of mature beta-cells.</description>

Each testicular sample was divided into several tissue fragments: 2 - 3 fragments were snap-frozen at -80C for nucleic acid extraction, several adjacent fragments were fixed overnight at 4C in Stieve's fluid or paraformaldehyde (PFA), and embedded in paraffin. Fixed sections were subsequently stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE) or with an antibody against placental-like alkaline phosphatase (ALPP or PLAP) for histological evaluation. Most samples of testicular parenchyma contained variable numbers of tubules with CIS cells. Samples where no tubules with CIS were found and complete spermatogenesis was present were used as a normal reference. In an attempt to limit the uncertainty about cellular differences between fragments from the same patient, we also made a direct print of the frozen fragment that specifically was used for RNA isolation. After staining with ALPP (PLAP) antibody, we could roughly confirm the approximate proportion of tubules with CIS as established by histology in adjacent tissue fragments. One sample from tissues containing approximately 50%, 75%, and 100% tubules with CIS cells, respectively, together with fragments with no neoplastic changes and preserved normal spermatogenesis (serving as the common reference) were chosen for microarray analysis.
 Hybridization - The slides were immersed at 42C in 6x standard saline citrate (SSC) / 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) / 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 40 minutes and carefully washed in ddH2O at room temperature. The attached PCR-products were then denatured at 95C in ddH2O for two minutes and then air dried. Prior to hybridization, the purified Cy3 / Cy5 labeled cDNA probes were mixed together. 5 µg poly-d-A and 5 µg human Cot1 DNA (both Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were added and the mixture evaporated in the Vacuum Concentrator 5301 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 45C to complete dryness. The pellet was dissolved in 70 µl hybridization buffer (50% formamide / 6x SSC / 0.5% SDS / 5x Denhardt's) and denatured by incubating at 95C for 2 minutes. The probe was hybridized with the microarray in a humid plastic bag at 42C for 16 hours. After hybridization, slides were washed in 2x SSC / 0.1% SDS for 5 minutes at 42C and then 10 min in 0.2x SSC / 0.1% SDS for 10 minutes at 42C. Slides was then quickly rinsed 3 times in 0.2x SSC / 0.1% SDS. Slides were dried by a brief centrifugation at 715g in a microtiter plate centrifuge (Z320; Hermle, Wehingen, Germany). After a quick dip in isopropanol and a quick spin dry again the slides were scanned immediately.
 Labeling - 5 µg of amplified RNA was labeled with Cy3-monofunctional reactive dyes (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, England) using the Atlas Glass Fluorescent Labelling Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, USA). 3 µg Random Primer (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used in the cDNA synthesis step.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was purified using the Macherey &amp; Nagel kit, DNase digested, and the RNA quality evaluated using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies Inc., CA, USA), 5 µg of total RNA was linearly amplified using the RiboAmp RNA amplification kit (Arcturus GmbH, Germany) yielding a 400-700 fold amplification of the mRNA in the samples. The amplified mRNA was re-evaluated on the Bioanalyzer 2100 and 5 µg was then subjected to indirect labeling with Cy3 and Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences) using the Atlas Glass Fluorescent labeling kit (BD Biosciences Clonetech, CA, USA).</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Image Adquisition - Slides were scanned at a 10 µm resolution using the GenePix 4000B Microarry-Scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Individual laser power and photomultiplier settings were used, allowing all signals to remain in the linear range of the scanner. Separate images for Cy3 and Cy5 were produced and analyzed by the ChipSkipper Microarray Data Evaluation Software (http://chipskipper.embl.de/). Integration grids were automatically centered to the images. For each spot total intensity and local background were calculated. Raw ratios were derived from background reduced signals. Normalization was carried out by intensity dependent windowed median ratio centering. The resulting data were further analyzed by Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).</field>

      <name>Transcription profiling of human heart with heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy</name>
      <description>End stage heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) have similar characteristics, enlargement of the ventricles, relatively thin-walled ventricle, which leads to a limited contraction force and blood loading. Nevertheless, the response for present therapeutics is very variable and the prognosis is still very bad for ICM and DCM in general. Thus, the ability to differentiate the etiologies of heart failure based structural and physiological changes of the heart would be a step forward to enhance the specificity and the success of given therapy.</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of human gene expression profiles of CD34+/CD38- cells vs AFT024</name>
      <description>It is widely accepted that hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) are tightly associated with discrete niches within the bone marrow. This molecular environment supports and regulates their self renewal and differentiation. AFT024 is a cell line derived from murine fetal liver that has been demonstrated to maintain human hematopoietic progenitors in an undifferentiated state in vitro. While various functional and genomic studies of this and other stromal layers have already been reported, the influence of the cellular microenvironment on the gene expression of HPC has not yet been systematically analyzed.&lt;br> &lt;br> The CD34+/CD38- fraction of human umbilical cord blood was parted and either cultivated on AFT024 [kindly provided by I. Lemischka] or without stromal feeder layer for 16h, 20h, 48h or 72h. Both fractions were then harvested and separated by vigorous pipetting and FACS sorted again to separate the HPC from AFT024. Global gene expression profiles were determined using a novel Human Genome cDNA Microarray of over 51,145 ESTs of the UnigenSet-RZPD3. In analogy, we have compared the gene expression profiles of CD34+/CD38- cells versus AFT024 to exclude that differential gene expression resulted from contaminating feeder layer cells.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - The murine fetal liver cell line AFT024 (a kind gift from I. R. Lemischka, Princeton University, Princeton) was maintained in DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, N.Y., USA) supplemented with 20% FCS, 50 µM 2-Mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) as described before. Cells were grown to confluency in 24- or 96-well plates precoated with 0.1% gelatin (Specialty Media, Lavette, NJ) and maintained at 33C. AFT024 cells were then irradiated with 2000 rads using a irradiator 24 hours prior to using the feeder layer. Media was then changed to RPMI supplemented with 20% FCS (R20), Penicillin 1000 U/ml, Streptomycin 100 U/ml, and 50 µmol/l 2ME. Medium was supplemented with Flf3-Ligand (FL) 10 ng/ml and Thrombopoietin (Tpo) 10 ng/ml.
 Sample Processing - CD34+Cd38- were cultivated without feeder layer as described under growth conditions for 16h prior to re-sort. Three independent fresh cord blood samples were pooled to gain enough material.
 Hybridization - The slides were immersed at 42°C in 6x standard saline citrate (SSC) / 0,5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) / 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 40 minutes and carefully washed in ddH2O at room temperature. The attached PCR-products were then denatured at 95°C in ddH2O for two minutes and then air dried. Prior to hybridization, the purified Cy3 / Cy5 labeled cDNA probes were mixed together. 20 µg poly-d-A and 20 µg human Cot1 DNA (both Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were added and the mixture evaporated in the Vacuum Concentrator 5301 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 60°C to complete dryness. The pellet was dissolved in 50 µl hybridization buffer (50% formamide / 6x SSC / 0.5% SDS / 5x Denhardt's) and denatured by incubating at 95°C for 2 minutes. The probe was hybridized with the microarray in a humid chamber in a water bath at 42°C for 16 hours. After hybridization, slides were washed in 0.1x SSC / 0.1% SDS for 10 minutes and then twice with 0.1x SSC for 5 minutes at 37°C with 130 RPM on an orbital shaker (Gio Gyrotory Shaker, New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, N.J.). Slides were dried by a brief centrifugation at 715g in a microtiter plate centrifuge (Z320; Hermle, Wehingen, Germany) and scanned immediately.
 Labeling - About 13000 cells from each fraction were lysed and total RNA isolated using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA-Isolation Kit (Arcturus, Mountain View, USA). DNase treatment was performed (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA quality was controlled with the RNA 6000 Pico LabChip kit (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). Linear amplification of mRNA was performed by in vitro transcription over two rounds using the Arcturus RiboAmp Kit (Arcturus, Mountain View, USA). The amplified RNA was analyzed by the RNA nano Lab Chip kit (Agilent) and by the SpectraMAX plus photometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, USA) at 260 nm. We obtained about 80 µg aRNA with a continuous spectrum of RNA length of 200 to 700 base pairs (results not shown). &lt;br> About 6 µg of aRNA were incubated with 3 µg Random Primer (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and labeled by amino-allyl-coupling using the Atlas Glass Fluorescent Labelling Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, USA) and Cy3-monofunctional reactive dye (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, England).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - About 10000 cells from each fraction were lysed and total RNA isolated using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA-Isolation Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Arcturus, Mountain View, USA). DNase treatment was performed (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA quality was controlled with the RNA 6000 Pico LabChip kit (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). Linear amplification of RNA was performed by in vitro transcription over two rounds using the Arcturus RiboAmp Kit (Arcturus, Mountain View, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

        <field name="data_protocol">Image Adquisition - Slides were scanned at a 5 µm resolution using the GenePix 4000B Microarry-Scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Individual laser power and photomultiplier settings were used, allowing all signals to remain in the linear range of the scanner. Separate images for Cy3 and Cy5 were produced and analyzed by the ChipSkipper Microarray Data Evaluation Software (http://www.ansorge-group.embl.de/chipskipper/index.htm). Integration grids were automatically centered to the images. For each spot total intensity and local background were calculated. Raw ratios were derived from background reduced signals. Normalization was carried out by intensity dependent windowed median ratio centering. The resulting data were further analyzed by Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).</field>

 Hybridization - Labeled RNA was dried to 27 ul using a vacuum drier at low heat setting. In order to facilitate hybridization efficiency, labeled RNA was fragmented using a fragmentation reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX). 3 ul of 10X fragmentation reagent were added and the mixture was incubated at 70 C for 15 minutes. The fragmentation reaction was inhibited by the addition of 3 ul stop reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX). Each Cy5-conjugated RNA was combined with an equal volume of Cy3-conjugated RNA. Nuclease-free water was added to each sample to a total volume of 70 ul followed by the addition of 1 ul of 10 mg/ml herring sperm DNA. 71 ul of 2X hybridization buffer (Proteomics Research Solutions Cat. No. PRS-16003050, Ann Arbor, MI) were added to the samples and they were incubated at 95 C for 5 minutes and centrifuged at 10,000g for 1 minute. Samples were loaded onto custom-printed oligo microarrays. Microarrays were hybridized in a Genomics Solution HybStation (Ann Arbor, MI) using a step-down protocol (42 C, 35 C, 30 C each for 5 hours). Microarrays were later washed with medium stringency buffer (PRS-16004001, Proteomics Research Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI) at 30 C for 2 minutes, followed by a high stringency buffer (PRS-16004501, Proteomics Research Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI) wash at 25 C for 2 minutes. Finally, microarrays were washed with post wash buffer (PRS-16003501, Proteomics Research Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI) at 25 C for 2 minutes. They were later dipped into deionized water for 30 seconds and were dried by centrifugation at 500 g for 1 minute. When there were more than 12 assays, hybridizations were done in batches of 12 in random order over several days.
 Labeling - Amplified RNA was thawed and dried using a vacuum dryer at low heat setting. RNA was reconstituted in 9 ul coupling buffer (Amino Allyl MessageAmp aRNA kit, Ambion, Austin, TX). Mono-functional NHS ester Cy3 or Cy5 dye, reconstituted in 11 ul DMSO, was added (Amersham Cy Dye Post-labelling Reactive Pack, GE Healthcare, UK). In all experiments, reference aRNA and sample aRNA were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent dyes, respectively, and were then incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at room temperature. 4.5 ul 4 M Hydroxylamine (Ambion, Austin, TX) was added for 15 minutes to quench the dye coupling reaction. Dye-coupled RNA was purified into nuclease-free water using the aRNA filter cartridges (Ambion MessageAmp kit) in order to remove excess dye. Final volume of dye-conjugated RNA was 150 ul.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Cells were lysed in a buffer containing guanidine isothiocyanate and beta-Mercaptoethanol. The lysate was homogenized and precipitated with 70% ethanol, transferred to a silica membrane column, and DNA and proteins were removed by a series of washes and centrifugations. Highly purified total RNA was then eluted from the column using RNase-free water. For the Nanoprep kit, 2 x 10 uL elutions were used. For the Microprep kit, 2 x 30 uL elutions were used.</field>

If so re-dissolve by warming at room temperature and keep at room temperature until used.&lt;br> &lt;br> Preparation before procedure &lt;br> 1. Lysis buffer: Buffer RLT + beta-ME beta-mercaptoethanol). Add 10 ul beta-ME per 1ml buffer RLT before use. &lt;br> 2. Calculate the total volume of RLT buffer required and add appropriate amount of beta-ME.&lt;br> 3. Add x 4 volumes of ethanol to Buffer RPE (as indicated on the bottle of the buffer), to obtain a working solution.&lt;br> 4. For the on-column DNase digestion with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen cat # 79254), prepare a DNase I stock solution by dissolving solid DNase I (1500 Kunitz units) in 550 ul RNase free-H2O provided in the kit. Mix gently by inverting the tube. DO NOT VORTEX. For long term storage, make single use (40 ul / tube; for 4 reactions) aliquots and store them at -20 C for up to 9 months. DO NOT FREEZE THAW. Before use thaw and DO NOT CENTRIFUGE.&lt;br> 5. NOTE: there are collection tubes of two different volumes; 1.5 ml for elution and 2 ml for all other steps.&lt;br> &lt;br> Procedure&lt;br> 1. Remove tissue culture supernatant from the adherent cells, save the supernatant at - 20C for further analysis.&lt;br> 2. Wash the adherent cells with 10 ml PBS once. &lt;br> 3. Just before you are ready to process the cells, remove the PBS and add 1.2 ml lysis buffer and scrape the cells using a cell scrapper. &lt;br> 4. Pipette 600 ul cell suspension into each of two Eppendorf tubes and vortex these samples.&lt;br> 5. Add 600 ul of 70% ethanol to the suspension, mix well by pipetting. DO NOT CENTRIFUGE. NOTE: A visible precipitate may form after the addition of ethanol; this will not affect the isolation procedure.&lt;br> 6. Apply 600 ul of sample to the RNeasy mini column placed in a 2 ml collection tube supplied with the kit (including any precipitate that is formed).&lt;br> 7. Close the tube gently, centrifuge for 15 sec at greater than 8000 x g (greater than 10,000 rpm).&lt;br> 8. Discard the flow through, reuse the collection tube, apply the rest of the sample to the mini column and repeat sample loading as in step 8.&lt;br> 9. Pipette 350 ul buffer RW1 into the mini column and centrifuge for 15 sec at greater than 8000 x g (greater than 10,000 rpm) to wash.&lt;br> 10. For each sample, add 10 ul DNase 1 stock solution to 70 ul Buffer RDD (supplied in the RNase-free DNase set; Qiagen cat # 79254). This volume supplies one reaction, so you can make appropriate amount depending on the number of reactions. Mix gently by inverting the tube.&lt;br> 11. NOTE: DNase I is especially sensitive to physical denaturation. Mixing should be carried out by gently inverting the tube. DO NOT VORTEX.&lt;br> 12.

      <name>Transcription profiling of human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) vs reference RNA of non-multipotent human fibroblasts HS68</name>
      <description>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) resemble a multipotent adult stem cell population capable of differentiation into a number of different mesodermal cell types including adipodytes, osteoblasts, chondroblasts. Although still in debate there is some evidence, that these cells can also differentiate into cells of non-mesodermal germal layers including hepatocytes, myocytes, cardiomyocytes or neurons. Analysis of these cells in the course of differentiation makes them an intriguing model for the examination of stemness. More importantly the differentiation capacity of MSC raises high hopes for clinical applications. In this study we have isolated MSC from bone marrow under two different culture conditions, from adipose tissue and from umbilical cord blood. The genome wide gene expression profile of these different human MSC was compared with reference RNA of non-multipotent human fibroblasts HS68. The aim of this study was to elucidate common molecular characteristics of MSC as well as differences in their expression profile.

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - In this study we analyzed mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from the bone marrow (BM) that were isolated form the same donors under two different growth conditions (M1 and M2). Bone marrow aspirates were obtained from the iliac crest of four healthy donors aged 25-35 years after approval by the Heidelberg University Ethical Board (approval nos.: 042/2000 and 251/2002). About 10-30 ml bone marrow aspirate were collected in a syringe containing 10,000 IU heparin to prevent coagulation. The mononuclear cell fraction was isolated by Biocoll density gradient centifugation (d=1.077 g/cm3; Biochrom, Germany). &lt;br> &lt;br> BM-MSC-M1 were cultivated as published before (Reyes et al. 2001). In brief, mononuclear cells were plated in expansion medium (M1) at a density of 100,000 cells/cm2 in tissue culture flasks (Nunc) coated with 10 ng/ml fibronectin (Sigma). The expansion medium consists of 58% Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium-Low Glucose (DMEM-LG, Cambrex) and 40% MCDB201 (Sigma), 2% FCS (Stemcell Technologies), supplemented with 2 mM L-Glutamine, 100 U/ml Pen/Strep (Gibco), 1% insulin transferrin selenium, 1% linoleic acid bovine serum albumin, 20 nM dexamethasone, 0.1 mM L-ascorbic-acid-2-phosphate (all from Sigma), PDGF-bb and EGF (10ng/ml each, R&amp;D Systems). On reaching 80% confluency, cells were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin /1ml EDTA (Invitrogen) and replated at 2,000-10,000 cells/cm2. Cells were expanded for 2-6 passages. Additionally, cells were successfully differentiated into bone, cartilage and fat following the standard protocols (Pittenger et al, 1999).&lt;br> 
 Hybridization - The slides were immersed at 42C in 6x standard saline citrate (SSC) / 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) / 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 40 minutes and carefully washed in ddH2O at room temperature. The attached PCR-products were then denatured at 95C in ddH2O for two minutes and then air dried. Prior to hybridization, the purified Cy3 / Cy5 labeled cDNA probes were mixed together. 10 ug poly-d-A and 10 ug human Cot1 DNA (both Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were added and the mixture evaporated in the Vacuum Concentrator 5301 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 60C to complete dryness. The pellet was dissolved in 50 ul hybridization buffer (50% formamide / 6x SSC / 0.5% SDS / 5x Denhardt's) and denatured by incubating at 95C for 2 minutes. The probe was hybridized with the microarray in a humid chamber in a water bath at 42C for 16 hours. After hybridization, slides were washed in 0.1x SSC / 0.1% SDS for 10 minutes and then twice with 0.1x SSC for 5 minutes at 37C with 130 rpm on an orbital shaker (Gio Gyrotory Shaker, New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, N.J.). Slides were dried by a brief centrifugation at 715 g in a microtiter plate centrifuge (Z320; Hermle, Wehingen, Germany) and scanned immediately.
 Labeling - About 10 ug of aRNA were incubated with 3 ug Random Primer (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) in a total volume of 10 ul at 70C for 10 min and then cooled on dry-ice. Labelling was performed by ammino-allyl-coupling using the Atlas Glass Fluorescent Labelling Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, USA) and Cy3-monofunctional reactive dye (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, England).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Cells isolated from 4 independent donors for each culture condition (BM-MSC-M1, BM-MSC-M2, AT-MSC-M1, CB-MSC-M3) were harvested upon reaching 70% confluency. In analogy RNA of HS68 cells was isolated four times. About 2x10^6 cells from each fraction were lysed and total RNA isolated using the Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNase treatment was performed (Quiagen). RNA quality was controlled with the RNA 6000 Pico LabChip kit (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). Linear amplification of 10 ug total RNA was performed by a one round in vitro transcription using the Arcturus RiboAmp Kit (Acturus, Mountain View, USA). RNA of HS68 cells was always amplified next to the MSC samples. The amplified RNA was analyzed by the RNA Nano Lab Chip kit (Agilent) and by the SpectraMAX plus photometer (Molecular devices, Sunnyvale, USA) at 260 nm. We gained about 100 ug aRNA with a continuous spectrum of RNA length of 200 to 1200 base pairs.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Image Adquisition - Slides were scanned at a 5 µm resolution using the GenePix 4000B Microarry-Scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Individual laser power and photomultiplier settings were used, allowing all signals to remain in the linear range of the scanner. Separate images for Cy3 and Cy5 were produced and analyzed by the ChipSkipper Microarray Data Evaluation Software (http://www.ansorge-group.embl.de/chipskipper/index.htm). Integration grids were automatically centered to the images. For each spot total intensity and local background were calculated. Raw ratios were derived from background reduced signals. Normalization was carried out by intensity dependent windowed median ratio centering. The resulting data were further analyzed by Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).</field>

      <name>Transcription profiling of mouse Ngn3-expressing pancreatic cells in a time series through embryonic development and adult islet cells</name>
      <description>Neurogenin3 (Ngn3) is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor which is expressed in scattered cells in the embryonic pancreas.  Mice deficient for Ngn3 fail to produce any pancreatic endocrine cells and die shortly after birth. Expression of transcription factors critical to pancreatic development (Isl1, NeuroD, Pax4, and Pax6) is missing and endocrine precursors are absent in mutant pancreatic epithelium. This study utilizes mice which were engineered to contain EGFP (Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein) under the control of the Ngn3 promoter.  In this way, cells which express Ngn3 can be FACS sorted and studied throughout embryonic development (E13.5, E14.5, E15.5, E16.5, and E17.5).  EGFP positive cells from the embryonic time-points in addition to adult islets (no cells expressing Ngn3) were hybridized to the BCBC PancChip 6.0 expression microarray, thus generating a profile of gene expression during this critical stage of development of the endocrine pancreas.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Hybridization - Slides are pre-hybridized in 5X-SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1% BSA at 42 C for 45 min. Rinsed 5X in deionized H20 and 1X in isopropanol and dried by centrifugation for 1 min at 1000 rpm. The cDNA hybridization mix was combined with mouse Cot-1 DNA and Oligo dT buffers and incubated overnight at 42 C in a Corning hybridization chamber. Coverslip removed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temp. Slide was washed once in 0.2X SSC, 0.1% SDS (42 C, 5 min, with agitation), once in 0.2X SSC (room temperature, 5 min, with agitation) and dried by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 3 min.
 Labeling - Cy dye is coupled to the DNA in the dark at room temperature (1 h). The reaction is then purified with a min-elute column (Qiagen).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - The RNeasy procedure represents a novel technology for RNA isolation. This technology combines the selective binding properties of a silica-gel-based membrane with the speed of microspin technology. A specialized high-salt buffer system allows RNA to bind to the RNeasy silica-gel membrane. Biological samples are first lysed and homogenized in the presence of a highly denaturing guanidine isothiocyanate (GITC)-containing buffer, which immediately inactivates RNases to ensure isolation of intact RNA. Ethanol is added to provide appropriate binding conditions, and the sample is then applied to an RNeasy column where the total RNA binds to the membrane and contaminants are efficiently washed away. High-quality RNA is then eluted in water.</field>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - To generate polarized cell cultures, 16HBE14O- cells were seeded in six-well Transwell permeable plates (Corning Life science, New York, USA) at a density of 1.5 to 3.75 x 105 cells / well. Cells were grown in complete MEM plus penicillin-streptomycin (50 units/ml) (Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada) at 37oC in 5% CO2 until they were polarized (14 days). Polarization was monitored by measuring the trans-epithelial cell resistance with a Millicell electrical resistance system (Millipore, Billerica, USA). Medium was replaced every other day with fresh medium and the night before an experiment it was replaced with fresh complete MEM without antibiotics. 
 Sample Processing - Mid-exponential phase broth cultures of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) were added to the apical surface&lt;br> &lt;br> of polarized cells at an MOI of 50 viable bacteria per cell.&lt;br> &lt;br> 16HBE14O- epithelial cells and bacteria were incubated together for 1h in complete MEM.&lt;br> &lt;br> The supernatants containing the bacteria were then replaced by fresh sterile medium and cells were incubated for a&lt;br> &lt;br> further 3 hours, after which they were lysed with the RLT lysis buffer supplemented with &amp;#946;-mercaptoethanol&lt;br> &lt;br> (RNeasy Mini kit, with RNase-Free DNase treatment (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)).&lt;br> &lt;br> 
 Hybridization -  Hybridization using Jack Bell 21K Human Microarray slides&lt;br> &lt;br> a. Pre-hybridization and pretreatment of slides:&lt;br> &lt;br> i. Prepare 500 ml pre-Hybridization Solution in MilliQ water as follows:&lt;br> &lt;br> 125 ml  20 x SSC (final conc 5X SSC)      &lt;br> 5ml 10% SDS (final conc 0.1% SDS)&lt;br> &lt;br> 1g  BSA (solid) (final conc 0.2% BSA)&lt;br> &lt;br> ii. Warm the pre-hyb solution to 37&amp;#61616;C to dissolve.&lt;br> iii. NOTE:  Use a cleaned pair of tweezers EVERY TIME you touch the slides.  Pre-hybridization buffer contains BSA and will leave a large streak down the slide, and ruin the subsequent scans.&lt;br> iv. Place slides into a clean wash vessel, pour approximately 450 ml of  pre-hyb buffer in and incubate at 48 &amp;#61616;C for 45 mins.  Make sure that the solution covers the slides.&lt;br> v. Wash the slides twice by dipping up and down around 10 times each in MilliQ water in clean wash vessels. &lt;br> vi. Wash the slides once by dipping up and down around 10 times in  RT isopropanol.&lt;br> vii. Spin dry the slides at 1,000 rpm for 5 mins at RT. &lt;br> viii. NOTE:  Make sure the slides are used within one hour of spinning dry.  Atmospheric humidity will cause problems.&lt;br> &lt;br> b.  1 mm LifterSlip cleaning (Eerie Scientific: 25X60I-2-4789)&lt;br> &lt;br> i. Dip lifter slip in clean dH2O&lt;br> ii.

Place the pretreated cover slips on slides, one at a time&lt;br> xi. Pipet all of the sample onto the spotted side of the pretreated slide under the short side of the lifter slip. Wait until the sample reaches the far side of the lifterslip and if required inject the last 5 -10 &amp;#61549;l of the sample under the far side of the lifterslip. [NOTE: Keep in mind the spotted side of the slide with respect to the barcode]&lt;br> xii.

 Labeling - In this protocol we use the Ambion kit # 1751, MessageAmp II which amplifies RNA producing aRNA ( cRNA).  This aRNA is hybridized to the 21 K slides purchased from Jack Bell Research Centre.&lt;br> &lt;br> Important Parameters for Successful Amplification&lt;br> &lt;br> Input RNA quantity and IVT reaction incubation Time&lt;br> &lt;br> Consider both the amount of sample RNA you have, and the amount of aRNA needed for your experiments when planning MessageAmp II experiments. These factors will influence how much input RNA is used, whether one or two rounds of amplification should be done, and how long to incubate the IVT reaction.&lt;br> &lt;br> Accurate quantification&lt;br> &lt;br> For experiments where the aRNA yield from different samples will be compared, it is&lt;br> Essential to accurately quantify the input RNA used in the MessageAmp II procedure. &lt;br> &lt;br> Recommended minimum and maximum amounts of input RNA&lt;br> &lt;br> Table 1 shows the mass of total RNA that can be used in the MessageAmp II aRNA procedure. Alternatively 10100 ng of poly(A) selected RNA can be used in the procedure. RNA must be in a maximum volume of 11 µl.&lt;br> &lt;br> Table 1: Amount of Total RNA to use in MessageAmp II.&lt;br> &lt;br> Amplification Recommended Minimum  Maximum&lt;br> Single Round 1000 ng 100 ng 5000 ng&lt;br> Two Rounds 100 ng 0.1 ng 100 ng&lt;br> &lt;br> RNA amount and IVT reaction incubation time&lt;br> &lt;br> The MessageAmp II procedure can accommodate a wide range of input RNA amounts, but for reproducible and comparable results, use a fixed amount of RNA for all experiments. Tailor both the amount of input RNA used and the amplification procedure to produce the amount of aRNA needed for your microarray hybridizations. For instance, Affymetrix GeneChips require 1015 µg of aRNA for each hybridization, but other commercial and core facility arrays may require slightly more or less aRNA.&lt;br> Figure 3 shows aRNA yields from different amounts of Control RNA amplified with increasing IVT incubation times. When amplifying small RNA samples however, (e.g. ~250 ng or less) incubating the IVT reaction for 14 hr will maximize the amount of aRNA produced.&lt;br> Typically 100 ng of total RNA input is the lower limit for synthesizing ~10 µg of aRNA using a 4 hr IVT reaction. If your total RNA samples will be ~100 ng or less, we advise conducting a preliminary amplification from a representative sample to determine empirically how much aRNA you can expect from your experimental samples. If the preliminary experiment does not produce enough aRNA for two array hybridizations, repeat the experiment using an IVT incubation as long as 14 hr, and/or consider using two rounds of amplification.&lt;br> &lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br> RNA Purity&lt;br> &lt;br> The single most important factor affecting how efficiently an RNA sample will be amplified using the MessageAmp II aRNA Kit is the quality of the RNA. RNA samples should be free of contaminating proteins, DNA, and other cellular material as well as phenol, ethanol, and salts associated with RNA isolation procedures.&lt;br> Impurities can lower the efficiency of reverse transcription and subsequently reduce the level of amplification. An effective measure of RNA purity is the ratio of absorbance readings at 260 and 280 nm. The ratio of A260 to A280 values should fall in the range of 1.72.1. RNA must be suspended in high quality water or TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA).&lt;br> &lt;br> RNA integrity&lt;br> The integrity of the RNA sample, or the proportion that is full-length, is another important component of RNA quality. Reverse transcribing partially degraded mRNAs will typically generate relatively short cDNAs that lack the sequence encoded upstream of the break in the RNA molecule.&lt;br> There are currently no quantitative methods for measuring what percentage of mRNAs in a sample are full-length, however several procedures do exist for establishing the relative integrity of a sample. A method that requires only nanogram quantities of RNA is microfluidic sample analysis using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and an RNA LabChip®&lt;br> Kit. The bioanalyzer fractionates RNA molecules according to size, so that the amounts&lt;br> of 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) can be determined. Primarily full-length RNA will exhibit a ratio of 28S to 18S rRNA bands that approaches 2:1.&lt;br> Denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and nucleic acid staining can also be used to separate and visualize the major rRNA species. When the RNA resolves into discrete rRNA bands (i.e. no significant smearing below each band), with the 28S rRNA band appearing approximately twice as intense as the 18S rRNA band, then the mRNA in the sample is likely to be mostly full-length. The primary drawback to gel electrophoresis is that  microgram amounts of RNA must be sacrificed.&lt;br> &lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br> Reaction Incubation times should be precise and consistent&lt;br> &lt;br> The incubation times in the protocol were optimized in conjunction with the kit reagents to ensure the maximum yield of nucleic acid product in each stepadhere to them closely.&lt;br> A range of 414 hr is given for the IVT reaction incubation time (step II.F.3 on page 13). Refer to the graph in Figure 3 on page 7 to help determine what incubation time to use. Keep this IVT incubation time uniform if aRNA yield from different samples will be compared, or if you want to have equal amplification of different samples. Although differences in IVT incubation time among samples has had very little, if any, effect on array results in our hands, we still recommend using a uniform IVT incubation time for the most reproducible amplification and array analysis.&lt;br> &lt;br> Master Mixes&lt;br> &lt;br> We strongly recommend preparing master mixes for the MessageAmp II procedure. This approach reduces the effects of pipetting error, and improves reproducibility. Using Master Mixes is especially important when aRNA yield from different samples will be compared.  Ambion provides a web-based Master Mix calculator at the following address: &lt;br> &lt;br> www.ambion.com/techlib/append/msgamp2_mm_calc.php&lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br> Thorough mixing is very important for reproducibility&lt;br> &lt;br> Below are specific instructions for mixing kit reagents, Master Mixes, and individual reactions. For maximum reproducibility and aRNA yield, follow these instructions closely. &lt;br>  Mix each kit component after thawing.&lt;br> &lt;br> Mix enzyme solutions by gently flicking the tube a few times before adding them to reactions. Thaw frozen reagents completely at room temperature (i.e. primers, nucleotides and 10 X buffers), then mix thoroughly by vortexing, and keep on ice before use.&lt;br>  Mix Master Mixes by gentle vortexing.&lt;br> &lt;br> After assembling Master Mixes, gently vortex to make a homogenous mixture without inactivating the enzyme(s).&lt;br> &lt;br>  Mix individual reactions by pipetting up and down 23 times, then flicking the tube 34 times, and finally spinning briefly.&lt;br> After adding Master Mixes or other reagents to individual reactions, pipet up and down 23 times to rinse reagents from the pipet tip. Then flick the tube with your finger 34 times to mix thoroughly, and finish by centrifuging briefly to collect the reaction at the bottom of the tube. &lt;br> &lt;br> Incubator recommendations&lt;br> &lt;br>  We recommend a calibrated hybridization oven or incubator (at constant temperature) for most of the MessageAmp II incubations.&lt;br> To avoid any potential influence on the reaction temperature from the tube holder, let tube holders equilibrate in the incubator for sufficient time, or use a tube holder that doesnt touch the sides and bottoms of the tubesfor example a floating tube support.&lt;br> &lt;br>  For the 16°C second strand synthesis reaction incubation (step II.D.2&lt;br> on page 11), we recommend using a thermal cycler&lt;br> . Ideally these reactions should be incubated in a calibrated thermal cycler with a lid temperature that matches the block temperature. Most machines do not have this feature, so if the lid temperature is static (~100°C), use it with the heat turned off, or do not use the heated lid at all. Otherwise heat from the lid will raise the temperature of the solution in the tube, compromising the reaction.&lt;br>  We do not recommend using heat blocks or water baths for MessageAmp II reaction incubations.&lt;br> The MessageAmp II procedure is very sensitive to temperature; therefore use incubators that have been professionally calibrated according the manufacturers recommended schedule. Variable or inaccurate incubation temperatures can limit aRNA synthesis. Preheat incubators if necessary so that the correct temperature has stabilized before reactions are placed in the incubator. It is also very important that condensation does&lt;br> not form in the reaction tubes during any of the incubations. Condensation changes the composition of reaction mixtures, and we have seen that it can greatly reduce yield.&lt;br> &lt;br> Maintaining consistency&lt;br> &lt;br> Procedural consistency is very important for planning amplification experiments. Consider implementing a detailed procedural plan that will be used by everyone in the lab to maintain consistency. This type of plan will minimize variation due to subtle procedural differences that can influence RNA amplification, and which may&lt;br> complicate gene expression studies. The plan should include basic information such as the method of RNA isolation, the amount of RNA to use in the procedure, and how long to incubate the IVT reaction. It should also address specifics that are not often included in protocols such as which tubes, tube racks, and incubators to use for each step in the process. Finally, develop a consistent work flow, for example standardize stopping points in the method. The idea is to standardize all of the variables discussed in this section of the Instruction Manual and carefully follow all the protocol steps in order to maximize amplification consistency among samples.&lt;br> &lt;br> Prepare the Wash Buffer&lt;br> &lt;br> Add 24 ml ACS grade 100% ethanol (ACS grade or better) to the bottle labeled aRNA Wash Buffer.

Place the tubes in a 16°C thermal cycler. It is important to cool the thermal cycler block to 16°C before adding the reaction tubes because subjecting the reactions to temperatures >16°C will compromise aRNA yield.&lt;br> 2. Incubate 2 hr at 16°C&lt;br>  Incubate 2 hr in a 16°C thermal cycler. If the lid temperature cannot be adjusted to match the 16°C block temperature, cover the reactions with the heated lid turned off, or if the lid cannot be turned offdo not cover the tubes with it. (Do not use a water bath or a heat block in a 4°C refrigerator for this incubation because the temperature will fluctuate too much.)&lt;br> &lt;br> 3. Place reactions on ice briefly or freeze immediately&lt;br> &lt;br> After the 2 hr incubation at 16°C, place the reactions on ice and proceed to. cDNA Purification (below), or immediately freeze reactions at 20°C. Do not leave the reactions on ice for long periods of time.&lt;br> This is a potential overnight stopping point, but it is better to complete the cDNA purification (next section) before stopping.&lt;br> &lt;br> cDNA Purification&lt;br> cDNA Filter Cartridges should not be subjected to RCFs over 16,000 x g because it could cause mechanical damage and/or may deposit glass filter fiber in the eluate.  All centrifugations in this purification procedure should be done at 10,000 x g (typically ~10,000 rpm) at room temp.&lt;br> &lt;br> 1. Preheat Nuclease-free Water to 5055°C&lt;br> Before beginning the cDNA purification, preheat the 10 ml bottle of Nuclease-free Water to 5055°C for at least 10 min.&lt;br> Preheat the Nuclease-free Water to a maximum of 55°C; temperatures above 58°C can partially denature the cDNA, compromising final yield of aRNA.&lt;br> &lt;br> 2. Add 250 µl cDNA Binding Buffer to each sample&lt;br> Add 250 µl of cDNA Binding Buffer to each sample from step D.2 on page 11, and mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down 23 times, then flicking the tube 34 times. Follow up with a quick spin to collect the reaction in the bottom of the tube. Proceed quickly to the next step.&lt;br> &lt;br> 3. Pass the mixture through a cDNA Filter Cartridge&lt;br> Before using them, check each cDNA Filter Cartridge to make sure that the filters are flush against the bottom of the mini-column; push them into place with the wide end of a pipet tip if necessary. Also check that the cDNA Filter Cartridge is firmly seated in its wash tube (supplied).&lt;br> a. Pipet the cDNA sample\cDNA Binding Buffer (from step 2) onto the center of the cDNA Filter Cartridge.&lt;br> b.

Transfer cDNA Filter Cartridge to a cDNA Elution Tube.&lt;br> &lt;br> 5. Elute cDNA with 2 X 9.0 µl 5055°C Nuclease-free Water&lt;br> It is important to use Nuclease-free Water that is at 5055°C for the cDNA elution. Colder water will be less efficient at eluting the cDNA, and hotter water (&amp;#8805;&amp;#2265;58°C) may result in reduced aRNA yield.&lt;br> &lt;br> a. Apply 9.0 µl of Nuclease-free Water (preheated to 5055°C) to the center of the filter in the cDNA Filter Cartridge.&lt;br> b. Leave at room temperature for 2 min and then centrifuge for ~1.5 min at 10,000 x g, or until all the Nuclease-free Water is through the filter.&lt;br> c. Elute with a second 9.0 µl of preheated Nuclease-free Water. The double-stranded cDNA will now be in the eluate (~14 µl).&lt;br> d. Proceed directly to section F. In Vitro Transcription to Synthesize aRNA, or place the cDNA at 20°C.&lt;br> The purified cDNA can be stored overnight at 20°C at this point if desired.&lt;br> &lt;br> In Vitro Transcription to Synthesize aRNA Incubator needed:&lt;br> &lt;br>  37°C (hybridization oven or incubator recommended)&lt;br> &lt;br> The IVT reaction can be set up to synthesize unmodified aRNA, or biotin-labeled nucleotides (or other modified nucleotides) can be incorporated into the aRNA during the IVT. Samples that will undergo two rounds of amplification cannot be labeled with biotin at this step because it would interfere with the second round of amplification.&lt;br> For the highest aRNA yield, conduct the IVT in a 40 µl final reaction volume. We provide instructions for a 20 µl biotin-labeled reaction for users who want to reduce the reaction cost by using only half the biotin-labeled nucleotides ( here we do not provide the protocol for biotin labeled nucleotides).&lt;br> &lt;br> Add IVT Master Mix to each sample&lt;br> At room temp, prepare an IVT Master Mix by adding the following reagents to a nuclease-free microfuge tube in the order listed below.

It is important to maintain a constant 37°C incubation temperature. We recommend incubating in an incubator such as a hybridization oven because it is extremely important that condensation does not form inside the tubes; this would change the reagent concentrations and reduce yield.&lt;br> &lt;br> Note: we incubate for 4 hours at 37°&lt;br> &lt;br> Add Nuclease-free Water to bring each sample to 100 µl&lt;br> Stop the reaction by adding Nuclease-free Water to each aRNA sample to bring the final volume to 100 µl.

Add x 4 volumes of ethanol to Buffer RPE (as indicated on the bottle of the buffer), to obtain a working solution.&lt;br> 4. For the on-column DNase digestion with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen cat # 79254), prepare a DNase I stock solution by dissolving solid DNase I (1500 Kunitz units) in 550 ul RNase free-H2O provided in the kit. Mix gently by inverting the tube. DO NOT VORTEX. For long term storage, make single use (40 ul / tube; for 4 reactions) aliquots and store them at -20 C for up to 9 months. DO NOT FREEZE THAW.

      <name>Transcription profiling of human monocytic cell line, THP-1 cells were stimulated 4 hours with chemokine MIG or CCL2/MCP-1</name>
      <description>The objective of the study was to discover new functions of chemokine CXCL9/MIG, a cationic chemokine that has antimicrobial properties.  Human monocytic cell line, THP-1 cells were stimulated 4 hours with chemokine MIG or CCL2/MCP-1 (a chemokine that is not positively charged and has no antimicrobial activity).  By using a 21,000 oligo-based DNA human microarray we analyzed gene expression profiles induced by MIG and by MCP-1.  The gene expression profile induced by MIG was >85% different from that induced by MCP-1. MIG increased transcription of genes encoding various chemokines (including CCL3/MIP-1alpha, CCL4/MIP-1beta, CCL2/MCP-1 and CXCL8/IL-8), cytokines (TNF-alpha), indicating that MIG has an immunomodulatory effect on THP-1 cells.  Additionally, MIG strongly up-regulated a set of genes identified as having tumor suppressor functions, including BTG2, BTG1, P21, IGFBP3, DSCR1 and genes encoding markers for mature leukocyte differentiation (PLAU, LPL, PLAUR etc). In parallel, MIG down-regulated the expression of oncogenes (MYC), and genes related to cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. This gene profile strongly suggested that the chemokine MIG had anti-proliferative activity and might induce THP-1 cells to undergo terminal differentiation.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - A human monocytic cell line, THP-1, were obtained from the American Type Culture (TIB-202) and was grown in RPMI-1640 media (Gibco, Invitrogen Life technologies, Burlington, ON), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (all from Invitrogen Life Technologies), 5 mM beta-mercaptometanol (Sigma).  Cultures were maintained at 37oC in a humidified 5% (v/v) CO2 incubator up to a maximum of six passages.  
 Sample Processing - THP-1 cells (at density of 1 x 10^6 cells/ml) were treated with water solvent for 4 hours. The RNA was then isolated for microarray study. All experiments were done for at least three biological replicates with two technical replicates each.
 Hybridization -  Hybridization using Jack Bell 21K Human Microarray slides&lt;br> &lt;br> a. Pre-hybridization and pretreatment of slides:&lt;br> &lt;br> i. Prepare 500 ml pre-Hybridization Solution in MilliQ water as follows:&lt;br> &lt;br> 125 ml  20 x SSC (final conc 5X SSC)      &lt;br> 5ml 10% SDS (final conc 0.1% SDS)&lt;br> &lt;br> 1g  BSA (solid) (final conc 0.2% BSA)&lt;br> &lt;br> ii. Warm the pre-hyb solution to 37&amp;#61616;C to dissolve.&lt;br> iii. NOTE:  Use a cleaned pair of tweezers EVERY TIME you touch the slides.  Pre-hybridization buffer contains BSA and will leave a large streak down the slide, and ruin the subsequent scans.&lt;br> iv. Place slides into a clean wash vessel, pour approximately 450 ml of  pre-hyb buffer in and incubate at 48 &amp;#61616;C for 45 mins.  Make sure that the solution covers the slides.&lt;br> v. Wash the slides twice by dipping up and down around 10 times each in MilliQ water in clean wash vessels. &lt;br> vi. Wash the slides once by dipping up and down around 10 times in  RT isopropanol.&lt;br> vii. Spin dry the slides at 1,000 rpm for 5 mins at RT. &lt;br> viii. NOTE:  Make sure the slides are used within one hour of spinning dry.  Atmospheric humidity will cause problems.&lt;br> &lt;br> b.  1 mm LifterSlip cleaning (Eerie Scientific: 25X60I-2-4789)&lt;br> &lt;br> i. Dip lifter slip in clean dH2O&lt;br> ii. Dip LifterSlip in 100% EtOH&lt;br> iii. Blow dry with clean air. You may use a Kimwipe to remove any other  blotches you are unable to remove by the above method&lt;br> &lt;br> Hybridization&lt;br> &lt;br> i. After analyzing your labeled samples by absorbance, take 20 pmol of Cy3-labelled sample and 20 pmol of Cy5-labelled sample and combine the samples to be hybridized on one slide together.  &lt;br> ii. Add 1 µl GFP labeled probe.&lt;br> iii. Speed vac the samples, DO NOT OVERDRY, try to leave around 1-2 &amp;#61549;l in the tube (dried nucleic acids dissolve poorly in hybridization buffer). In case the sample goes completely dry add 1  2 &amp;#61549;l NF- water to the pellet and tap and re-suspend.  &lt;br> iv. Make up hybridization solution master mix for all the slides. &lt;br> v. For each 80 &amp;#61549;l hybridization solution add the following in the master mix: &lt;br> &lt;br> 72.8 &amp;#61549;l DIG Easy hyb solution&lt;br> 3.6 &amp;#61549;l salmon sperm DNA (10 mg/ml)[Ambion]&lt;br> 3.6 &amp;#61549;l tRNA (10 mg/ml) [Ambion]&lt;br> 0.28 &amp;#61549;l poly dA (1 &amp;#61549;g/ml) [Ambion]&lt;br> Dry down 8&amp;#61549;g of human cot-1 DNA [Invitrogen, catalog # 15279-011]  and resuspend in the above mix&lt;br> &lt;br> [If you want more volume of hyb buffer / slide depending on slide, keep the ratios of the components consistent]&lt;br>  &lt;br> vi. Add 80 &amp;#61549;l of the hybridization buffer to each tube with the speed vac-concentrated samples. &lt;br> vii. Mix the sample with the hybridization buffer and denature the sample at 90&amp;#61616;C for 1 min.&lt;br> viii. Keep the sample on ice for at least 1 min.&lt;br> ix. Remove it from ice, spin down quickly using table top microcentrifuge and keep samples covered from light at RT or warmer until ready to put on slide.&lt;br> x. Place the pretreated cover slips on slides, one at a time&lt;br> xi. Pipet all of the sample onto the spotted side of the pretreated slide under the short side of the lifter slip. Wait until the sample reaches the far side of the lifterslip and if required inject the last 5 -10 &amp;#61549;l of the sample under the far side of the lifterslip. [NOTE: Keep in mind the spotted side of the slide with respect to the barcode]&lt;br> xii. Place the slide in a corning cassette with 10 &amp;#61549;l NF-H2O in each well of the cassette and close.&lt;br> xiii. Seal Hybridization Chamber.  Incubate on a level surface in a humidified chamber at 37°C for at least  overnight (18 hrs).&lt;br> &lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br>  Washing&lt;br> &lt;br> i. Immerse the pair of slides in 1 X SSC and slide the arrays past one another.  NOTE: wash forceps in 70% EtOH between samples and between the various steps to reduce streaking.&lt;br> ii. Pre-warm 1 X SSC / 0.1 % SDS at 37 &amp;#61616;C, wash the slides twice for 5 mins each at 37°C in pre-warmed 1X SSC / 0.1% SDS with gentle occasional agitation ( make one litre of 1XSSC/0.1% SDS and incubate at 37°C to pre-warm it overnight)&lt;br> iii. &lt;br> 1 L of 1X SSC/ 0.1% SDS&lt;br> &lt;br> 20 X SSC 50ml&lt;br> 10% SDS 10ml&lt;br> MQ Water 940 ml&lt;br> &lt;br> iv. Wash the slides in 1X SSC for 3 mins followed by wash in 0.1X SSC for 3 mins to completely remove the SDS.&lt;br> &lt;br> 1000 ml of 1X SSC  500 ml of 0.1X SSC&lt;br> &lt;br> 20X SSC  50ml             20X SSC  2.5ml&lt;br> MQ Water  950 ml  MQ Water  997.5ml&lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br> v. Place the slides in a 50 ml falcon tube, DO NOT PLACE LID ON THE TUBE.  Keep some kimwipe on the bottom of the tube, place barcode facing the bottom of the tube and place in centrifuge with barcode facing out.&lt;br> vi. Spin dry the slides at 1,000 rpm for 5 min in room temp in the 50 ml tube.&lt;br> vii. Store the slides in dark before scanning and analysis.&lt;br>
 Labeling - In this protocol we use the Ambion kit # 1751, MessageAmp II which amplifies RNA producing aRNA ( cRNA).  This aRNA is hybridized to the 21 K slides purchased from Jack Bell Research Centre.&lt;br> &lt;br> Important Parameters for Successful Amplification&lt;br> &lt;br> Input RNA quantity and IVT reaction incubation Time&lt;br> &lt;br> Consider both the amount of sample RNA you have, and the amount of aRNA needed for your experiments when planning MessageAmp II experiments. These factors will influence how much input RNA is used, whether one or two rounds of amplification should be done, and how long to incubate the IVT reaction.&lt;br> &lt;br> Accurate quantification&lt;br> &lt;br> For experiments where the aRNA yield from different samples will be compared, it is&lt;br> Essential to accurately quantify the input RNA used in the MessageAmp II procedure. &lt;br> &lt;br> Recommended minimum and maximum amounts of input RNA&lt;br> &lt;br> Table 1 shows the mass of total RNA that can be used in the MessageAmp II aRNA procedure. Alternatively 10100 ng of poly(A) selected RNA can be used in the procedure. RNA must be in a maximum volume of 11 µl.&lt;br> &lt;br> Table 1: Amount of Total RNA to use in MessageAmp II.&lt;br> &lt;br> Amplification Recommended Minimum  Maximum&lt;br> Single Round 1000 ng 100 ng 5000 ng&lt;br> Two Rounds 100 ng 0.1 ng 100 ng&lt;br> &lt;br> RNA amount and IVT reaction incubation time&lt;br> &lt;br> The MessageAmp II procedure can accommodate a wide range of input RNA amounts, but for reproducible and comparable results, use a fixed amount of RNA for all experiments. Tailor both the amount of input RNA used and the amplification procedure to produce the amount of aRNA needed for your microarray hybridizations. For instance, Affymetrix GeneChips require 1015 µg of aRNA for each hybridization, but other commercial and core facility arrays may require slightly more or less aRNA.&lt;br> Figure 3 shows aRNA yields from different amounts of Control RNA amplified with increasing IVT incubation times. When amplifying small RNA samples however, (e.g. ~250 ng or less) incubating the IVT reaction for 14 hr will maximize the amount of aRNA produced.&lt;br> Typically 100 ng of total RNA input is the lower limit for synthesizing ~10 µg of aRNA using a 4 hr IVT reaction. If your total RNA samples will be ~100 ng or less, we advise conducting a preliminary amplification from a representative sample to determine empirically how much aRNA you can expect from your experimental samples. If the preliminary experiment does not produce enough aRNA for two array hybridizations, repeat the experiment using an IVT incubation as long as 14 hr, and/or consider using two rounds of amplification.&lt;br> &lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br> RNA Purity&lt;br> &lt;br> The single most important factor affecting how efficiently an RNA sample will be amplified using the MessageAmp II aRNA Kit is the quality of the RNA. RNA samples should be free of contaminating proteins, DNA, and other cellular material as well as phenol, ethanol, and salts associated with RNA isolation procedures.&lt;br> Impurities can lower the efficiency of reverse transcription and subsequently reduce the level of amplification. An effective measure of RNA purity is the ratio of absorbance readings at 260 and 280 nm. The ratio of A260 to A280 values should fall in the range of 1.72.1. RNA must be suspended in high quality water or TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA).&lt;br> &lt;br> RNA integrity&lt;br> The integrity of the RNA sample, or the proportion that is full-length, is another important component of RNA quality. Reverse transcribing partially degraded mRNAs will typically generate relatively short cDNAs that lack the sequence encoded upstream of the break in the RNA molecule.&lt;br> There are currently no quantitative methods for measuring what percentage of mRNAs in a sample are full-length, however several procedures do exist for establishing the relative integrity of a sample. A method that requires only nanogram quantities of RNA is microfluidic sample analysis using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and an RNA LabChip®&lt;br> Kit. The bioanalyzer fractionates RNA molecules according to size, so that the amounts&lt;br> of 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) can be determined. Primarily full-length RNA will exhibit a ratio of 28S to 18S rRNA bands that approaches 2:1.&lt;br> Denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and nucleic acid staining can also be used to separate and visualize the major rRNA species. When the RNA resolves into discrete rRNA bands (i.e. no significant smearing below each band), with the 28S rRNA band appearing approximately twice as intense as the 18S rRNA band, then the mRNA in the sample is likely to be mostly full-length. The primary drawback to gel electrophoresis is that  microgram amounts of RNA must be sacrificed.&lt;br> &lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br> Reaction Incubation times should be precise and consistent&lt;br> &lt;br> The incubation times in the protocol were optimized in conjunction with the kit reagents to ensure the maximum yield of nucleic acid product in each stepadhere to them closely.&lt;br> A range of 414 hr is given for the IVT reaction incubation time (step II.F.3 on page 13). Refer to the graph in Figure 3 on page 7 to help determine what incubation time to use. Keep this IVT incubation time uniform if aRNA yield from different samples will be compared, or if you want to have equal amplification of different samples. Although differences in IVT incubation time among samples has had very little, if any, effect on array results in our hands, we still recommend using a uniform IVT incubation time for the most reproducible amplification and array analysis.&lt;br> &lt;br> Master Mixes&lt;br> &lt;br> We strongly recommend preparing master mixes for the MessageAmp II procedure. This approach reduces the effects of pipetting error, and improves reproducibility. Using Master Mixes is especially important when aRNA yield from different samples will be compared.  Ambion provides a web-based Master Mix calculator at the following address: &lt;br> &lt;br> www.ambion.com/techlib/append/msgamp2_mm_calc.php&lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br> Thorough mixing is very important for reproducibility&lt;br> &lt;br> Below are specific instructions for mixing kit reagents, Master Mixes, and individual reactions. For maximum reproducibility and aRNA yield, follow these instructions closely. &lt;br>  Mix each kit component after thawing.&lt;br> &lt;br> Mix enzyme solutions by gently flicking the tube a few times before adding them to reactions. Thaw frozen reagents completely at room temperature (i.e. primers, nucleotides and 10 X buffers), then mix thoroughly by vortexing, and keep on ice before use.&lt;br>  Mix Master Mixes by gentle vortexing.&lt;br> &lt;br> After assembling Master Mixes, gently vortex to make a homogenous mixture without inactivating the enzyme(s).&lt;br> &lt;br>  Mix individual reactions by pipetting up and down 23 times, then flicking the tube 34 times, and finally spinning briefly.&lt;br> After adding Master Mixes or other reagents to individual reactions, pipet up and down 23 times to rinse reagents from the pipet tip. Then flick the tube with your finger 34 times to mix thoroughly, and finish by centrifuging briefly to collect the reaction at the bottom of the tube. &lt;br> &lt;br> Incubator recommendations&lt;br> &lt;br>  We recommend a calibrated hybridization oven or incubator (at constant temperature) for most of the MessageAmp II incubations.&lt;br> To avoid any potential influence on the reaction temperature from the tube holder, let tube holders equilibrate in the incubator for sufficient time, or use a tube holder that doesnt touch the sides and bottoms of the tubesfor example a floating tube support.&lt;br> &lt;br>  For the 16°C second strand synthesis reaction incubation (step II.D.2&lt;br> on page 11), we recommend using a thermal cycler&lt;br> . Ideally these reactions should be incubated in a calibrated thermal cycler with a lid temperature that matches the block temperature. Most machines do not have this feature, so if the lid temperature is static (~100°C), use it with the heat turned off, or do not use the heated lid at all. Otherwise heat from the lid will raise the temperature of the solution in the tube, compromising the reaction.&lt;br>  We do not recommend using heat blocks or water baths for MessageAmp II reaction incubations.&lt;br> The MessageAmp II procedure is very sensitive to temperature; therefore use incubators that have been professionally calibrated according the manufacturers recommended schedule. Variable or inaccurate incubation temperatures can limit aRNA synthesis. Preheat incubators if necessary so that the correct temperature has stabilized before reactions are placed in the incubator. It is also very important that condensation does&lt;br> not form in the reaction tubes during any of the incubations. Condensation changes the composition of reaction mixtures, and we have seen that it can greatly reduce yield.&lt;br> &lt;br> Maintaining consistency&lt;br> &lt;br> Procedural consistency is very important for planning amplification experiments. Consider implementing a detailed procedural plan that will be used by everyone in the lab to maintain consistency. This type of plan will minimize variation due to subtle procedural differences that can influence RNA amplification, and which may&lt;br> complicate gene expression studies. The plan should include basic information such as the method of RNA isolation, the amount of RNA to use in the procedure, and how long to incubate the IVT reaction. It should also address specifics that are not often included in protocols such as which tubes, tube racks, and incubators to use for each step in the process. Finally, develop a consistent work flow, for example standardize stopping points in the method. The idea is to standardize all of the variables discussed in this section of the Instruction Manual and carefully follow all the protocol steps in order to maximize amplification consistency among samples.&lt;br> &lt;br> Prepare the Wash Buffer&lt;br> &lt;br> Add 24 ml ACS grade 100% ethanol (ACS grade or better) to the bottle labeled aRNA Wash Buffer.

Mix well by gently vortexing. Centrifuge briefly (~5 sec) to collect the Second Strand Master Mix at the bottom of the tube and place on ice.&lt;br> c. Transfer 80 µl of Second Strand Master Mix to each sample, mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down 23 times, then flicking the tube 34 times, and follow up with a quick spin to collect the reaction in the bottom of the tube.&lt;br> d. Place the tubes in a 16°C thermal cycler. It is important to cool the thermal cycler block to 16°C before adding the reaction tubes because subjecting the reactions to temperatures >16°C will compromise aRNA yield.&lt;br> 2. Incubate 2 hr at 16°C&lt;br>  Incubate 2 hr in a 16°C thermal cycler. If the lid temperature cannot be adjusted to match the 16°C block temperature, cover the reactions with the heated lid turned off, or if the lid cannot be turned offdo not cover the tubes with it. (Do not use a water bath or a heat block in a 4°C refrigerator for this incubation because the temperature will fluctuate too much.)&lt;br> &lt;br> 3. Place reactions on ice briefly or freeze immediately&lt;br> &lt;br> After the 2 hr incubation at 16°C, place the reactions on ice and proceed to. cDNA Purification (below), or immediately freeze reactions at 20°C. Do not leave the reactions on ice for long periods of time.&lt;br> This is a potential overnight stopping point, but it is better to complete the cDNA purification (next section) before stopping.&lt;br> &lt;br> cDNA Purification&lt;br> cDNA Filter Cartridges should not be subjected to RCFs over 16,000 x g because it could cause mechanical damage and/or may deposit glass filter fiber in the eluate.  All centrifugations in this purification procedure should be done at 10,000 x g (typically ~10,000 rpm) at room temp.&lt;br> &lt;br> 1. Preheat Nuclease-free Water to 5055°C&lt;br> Before beginning the cDNA purification, preheat the 10 ml bottle of Nuclease-free Water to 5055°C for at least 10 min.&lt;br> Preheat the Nuclease-free Water to a maximum of 55°C; temperatures above 58°C can partially denature the cDNA, compromising final yield of aRNA.&lt;br> &lt;br> 2. Add 250 µl cDNA Binding Buffer to each sample&lt;br> Add 250 µl of cDNA Binding Buffer to each sample from step D.2 on page 11, and mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down 23 times, then flicking the tube 34 times. Follow up with a quick spin to collect the reaction in the bottom of the tube. Proceed quickly to the next step.&lt;br> &lt;br> 3. Pass the mixture through a cDNA Filter Cartridge&lt;br> Before using them, check each cDNA Filter Cartridge to make sure that the filters are flush against the bottom of the mini-column; push them into place with the wide end of a pipet tip if necessary. Also check that the cDNA Filter Cartridge is firmly seated in its wash tube (supplied).&lt;br> a. Pipet the cDNA sample\cDNA Binding Buffer (from step 2) onto the center of the cDNA Filter Cartridge.&lt;br> b. Centrifuge for ~1 min at 10,000 x g, or until the mixture is through the filter.&lt;br> c. Discard the flow-through and replace the cDNA Filter Cartridge in the wash tube.&lt;br> Make sure that the ethanol has been added to the bottle of Wash Buffer before using it in the next step.&lt;br> &lt;br> 4. Wash with 500 µl Wash Buffer&lt;br> &lt;br> Prepare the Wash Buffer&lt;br> Add 24 ml ACS grade 100% ethanol (ACS grade or better) to the bottle labeled aRNA Wash Buffer. Mix well and mark the label to indicate that the ethanol was added.&lt;br> &lt;br> a. Apply 500 µl cDNA Wash Buffer to each cDNA Filter Cartridge.&lt;br> b. Centrifuge for ~1 min at 10,000 X g, or until all the cDNA Wash Buffer is through the filter.&lt;br> c. Discard the flow-through and spin the cDNA Filter Cartridge for an additional minute to remove trace amounts of ethanol.&lt;br> d. Transfer cDNA Filter Cartridge to a cDNA Elution Tube.&lt;br> &lt;br> 5. Elute cDNA with 2 X 9.0 µl 5055°C Nuclease-free Water&lt;br> It is important to use Nuclease-free Water that is at 5055°C for the cDNA elution. Colder water will be less efficient at eluting the cDNA, and hotter water (&amp;#8805;&amp;#2265;58°C) may result in reduced aRNA yield.&lt;br> &lt;br> a. Apply 9.0 µl of Nuclease-free Water (preheated to 5055°C) to the center of the filter in the cDNA Filter Cartridge.&lt;br> b. Leave at room temperature for 2 min and then centrifuge for ~1.5 min at 10,000 x g, or until all the Nuclease-free Water is through the filter.&lt;br> c. Elute with a second 9.0 µl of preheated Nuclease-free Water. The double-stranded cDNA will now be in the eluate (~14 µl).&lt;br> d. Proceed directly to section F. In Vitro Transcription to Synthesize aRNA, or place the cDNA at 20°C.&lt;br> The purified cDNA can be stored overnight at 20°C at this point if desired.&lt;br> &lt;br> In Vitro Transcription to Synthesize aRNA Incubator needed:&lt;br> &lt;br>  37°C (hybridization oven or incubator recommended)&lt;br> &lt;br> The IVT reaction can be set up to synthesize unmodified aRNA, or biotin-labeled nucleotides (or other modified nucleotides) can be incorporated into the aRNA during the IVT. Samples that will undergo two rounds of amplification cannot be labeled with biotin at this step because it would interfere with the second round of amplification.&lt;br> For the highest aRNA yield, conduct the IVT in a 40 µl final reaction volume. We provide instructions for a 20 µl biotin-labeled reaction for users who want to reduce the reaction cost by using only half the biotin-labeled nucleotides ( here we do not provide the protocol for biotin labeled nucleotides).&lt;br> &lt;br> Add IVT Master Mix to each sample&lt;br> At room temp, prepare an IVT Master Mix by adding the following reagents to a nuclease-free microfuge tube in the order listed below. Assemble enough to synthesize aRNA from all the samples in the experiment, including &amp;#8804;5% overage to cover pipetting error. We provide a master mix calculator on our website to calculate reagent amounts: www.ambion.com/techlib/append/msgamp2_mm_calc.php&lt;br> &lt;br> If two rounds of amplification will be done, this first round transcription should be unmodified, containing only unmodified CTP and UTP.&lt;br> Assemble the IVT Master Mix at room temp in the order shown:&lt;br> &lt;br> Note: amino-allyl-UTP (aa-UTP) is purchased separately from Ambion (Cat. # 8437).&lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br> Table 4: IVT Master Mix&lt;br> &lt;br> Component  Amount in µL&lt;br> Double stranded cDNA ( 14) from the previous step&lt;br> T7 ATP solution 75 mM 4&lt;br> T7 CTP solution 75 mM 4&lt;br> T7 GTP solution 75 mM 4&lt;br> T7 UTP solution 75 mM 3&lt;br> Amino-allyl-UTP 50 mM 3 (purchased separately from Ambion)&lt;br> T7 10X reaction buffer 4&lt;br> T7 Enzyme mix 4&lt;br> Total 26&lt;br> &lt;br> b.

It is important to maintain a constant 37°C incubation temperature. We recommend incubating in an incubator such as a hybridization oven because it is extremely important that condensation does not form inside the tubes; this would change the reagent concentrations and reduce yield.&lt;br> &lt;br> Note: we incubate for 4 hours at 37°&lt;br> &lt;br> Add Nuclease-free Water to bring each sample to 100 µl&lt;br> Stop the reaction by adding Nuclease-free Water to each aRNA sample to bring the final volume to 100 µl.

Transfer Filter Cartridge(s) to a fresh aRNA Collection Tube.&lt;br> &lt;br> 7. Elute aRNA with 100 µ preheated Nuclease-free Water&lt;br> a. To the center of the filter, add 100 µl Nuclease-free Water that is preheated to 5060°C.&lt;br> b. Leave at room temperature for 2 min and then centrifuge for ~1.5 min at 10,000 X g, or until the solution is through the filter.&lt;br> c. The aRNA will now be in the aRNA Collection Tube in ~100 µl of Nuclease-free Water.&lt;br> The purified aRNA can be stored at 20°C overnight, or at 80°C for longer times if desired.&lt;br> &lt;br> Amino Allyl aRNA:Dye Coupling and Clean-up&lt;br> This kit was developed with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes from Amersham Pharmacia&lt;br> Biotech, but mono-reactive NHS esters of any label moiety&lt;br> should be capable of coupling to the amino allyl modified aRNA generated&lt;br> with this kit.

To couple an aRNA to more than one dye, transfer the aRNA per dye to a single tube and vacuum dry to 7 µl per&lt;br> dye. &lt;br> If the heater on the vacuum centrifuge is adjustable, use the medium or low temperature setting.&lt;br> Check the progress of drying every 510 min, and remove the sample from the concentrator when it reaches the desired volume; do not overdry.&lt;br> &lt;br> NHS Ester Dye Preparation&lt;br> Prepare dye immediately before starting the dye coupling procedures. The preparation and storage of solubilized dye is important for the efficient labeling of amino allyl modified aRNA. It is imperative that the dye compounds remain&lt;br> dry both before and after dissolving in DMSO because any water that is introduced will cause hydrolysis of the NHS esters, lowering the efficiency of coupling.&lt;br> &lt;br> IMPORTANT&lt;br> Store any unused solubilized dye in the dark at 80°C. Note that most dye&lt;br> manufacturers do not recommend storing solubilized dyes for more than&lt;br> ~1 month.&lt;br> &lt;br> Amersham Biosciences FluoroLink Cy5 (PA25001) and Cy3 (PA23001) monofunctional dye 5-pack&lt;br> &lt;br> These dyes are supplied in relatively large aliquots; resuspend one dye vial in 32 µl of DMSO and keep in the dark at room temp for up to 1 hr until you are ready to use it.

To keep the samples in the dark, typically it is sufficient to simply put the tubes in a closed drawer.&lt;br> &lt;br> Add 4.5 µl 4M Hydroxylamine, mix, and incubate 15 min at room temp in the dark&lt;br> To quench the reaction, add 4.5 µl 4M Hydroxylamine and mix well. Incubate the reaction at room temperature in the dark for 15 minutes.  During this incubation, the large molar excess of hydroxylamine will quench the amine-reactive groups on the unreacted dye molecules.&lt;br> &lt;br> Dye Labeled aRNA Purification&lt;br> &lt;br> Repeat the aRNA purification protocol described above using the kit Mega Clear from Ambion (Cat. # 1908).

If so re-dissolve by warming at room temperature and keep at room temperature until used.&lt;br> &lt;br> Preparation before procedure &lt;br> 1. Lysis buffer: Buffer RLT + beta-ME beta-mercaptoethanol). Add 10 ul beta-ME per 1ml buffer RLT before use. &lt;br> 2. Calculate the total volume of RLT buffer required and add appropriate amount of beta-ME.&lt;br> 3. Add x 4 volumes of ethanol to Buffer RPE (as indicated on the bottle of the buffer), to obtain a working solution.&lt;br> 4. For the on-column DNase digestion with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen cat # 79254), prepare a DNase I stock solution by dissolving solid DNase I (1500 Kunitz units) in 550 ul RNase free-H2O provided in the kit. Mix gently by inverting the tube. DO NOT VORTEX. For long term storage, make single use (40 ul / tube; for 4 reactions) aliquots and store them at -20 C for up to 9 months. DO NOT FREEZE THAW. Before use thaw and DO NOT CENTRIFUGE.&lt;br> 5. NOTE: there are collection tubes of two different volumes; 1.5 ml for elution and 2 ml for all other steps.&lt;br> &lt;br> Procedure&lt;br> 1. Remove tissue culture supernatant from the adherent cells, save the supernatant at - 20C for further analysis.&lt;br> 2. Wash the adherent cells with 10 ml PBS once. &lt;br> 3. Just before you are ready to process the cells, remove the PBS and add 1.2 ml lysis buffer and scrape the cells using a cell scrapper. &lt;br> 4. Pipette 600 ul cell suspension into each of two Eppendorf tubes and vortex these samples.&lt;br> 5. Add 600 ul of 70% ethanol to the suspension, mix well by pipetting. DO NOT CENTRIFUGE. NOTE: A visible precipitate may form after the addition of ethanol; this will not affect the isolation procedure.&lt;br> 6. Apply 600 ul of sample to the RNeasy mini column placed in a 2 ml collection tube supplied with the kit (including any precipitate that is formed).&lt;br> 7. Close the tube gently, centrifuge for 15 sec at greater than 8000 x g (greater than 10,000 rpm).&lt;br> 8. Discard the flow through, reuse the collection tube, apply the rest of the sample to the mini column and repeat sample loading as in step 8.&lt;br> 9. Pipette 350 ul buffer RW1 into the mini column and centrifuge for 15 sec at greater than 8000 x g (greater than 10,000 rpm) to wash.&lt;br> 10. For each sample, add 10 ul DNase 1 stock solution to 70 ul Buffer RDD (supplied in the RNase-free DNase set; Qiagen cat # 79254). This volume supplies one reaction, so you can make appropriate amount depending on the number of reactions. Mix gently by inverting the tube.&lt;br> 11. NOTE: DNase I is especially sensitive to physical denaturation. Mixing should be carried out by gently inverting the tube. DO NOT VORTEX.&lt;br> 12. Add 80 ul of the DNase I incubation mix DIRECTLY onto the silica-gel membrane of the column and place on bench top (RT) for 15 min.&lt;br> 13. NOTE: Make sure to pipette the DNase I incubation mix DIRECTLY onto the Silica-gel of the mini column. DNase digestion will be incomplete if part of it sticks to the walls or the O-ring of the column.&lt;br> 14. Pipette 350 ul Buffer RW1 into the mini column and centrifuge for 15 sec at greater than 8000 x g (greater than 10,000 rpm), discard the flow through.&lt;br> 15. Transfer the RNeasy column to a new 2 ml collection tube, pipette 500 ul Buffer RPE onto the column, close the tube gently and centrifuge for 15 sec at greater than 8000 x g (greater than 10,000 rpm) to wash. Discard flow thru. This wash is done X 2.&lt;br> 16. After the second wash, discarding the flow through each time, gently close the tube and centrifuge for 2 min at greater than 8000 x g (greater than 10,000 rpm) to dry the RNeasy silica gel membrane.&lt;br> 17. Place the column in a new 1.5 ml collection tube for elution.&lt;br> 18. Pipette 30 ul RNase-free water directly onto the silica-gel membrane. Close the tube gently and centrifuge for 1 min at greater than 8000 x g (greater than 10,000 rpm). Repeat these elution steps twice. The total sample volume eluted from the columns will be around 60 ul.&lt;br> 19. Pool the two identical samples together, the total volume per sample will be 120 ul.&lt;br> 20. Speed vac and concentrate the sample to approximately less than one-third the volume. &lt;br> 21. NOTE: Required concentration of total RNA for microarrays cannot be less than 1 ug/ul.&lt;br> 22.

Place 100 ul of the diluted RNA samples in a disposable UVette and read absorbance using the program for RNA concentration in the spectrophotomer in room 235. &lt;br> 27. Record the dilution factor in the spectrophotomer as per the program to get the right concentration in ng/ul.&lt;br> 28. Read measure OD 260 and OD 260/280 ratio.&lt;br&gt; 29. Run approximately 1 ug of sample (approximately 3 ul) per well on a 1% Agarose gel. Run gel at 100 V for about 40 mins, until the dye front has run approximately half the length of the gel.&lt;br> 30. The gel image must be stored and recorded before submitting the sample for microarray analysis.&lt;br> 31. Bioanalysis of the RNA using Agilent will be done before determining the input RNA concentration for microarrays.&lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br></field>

      <description>The objective of the study was to evaluate transcriptional response of endotoxin-stimulated human monocytic cells in presence and absence of host defense peptide LL-37.  A functional genomics approach was used to establish a temporal transcriptional profile and identify differentially expressed genes in LPS (100ng/ml)-stimulated human monocytic THP-1 cells, in the presence or absence of LL-37 (20ug/ml) after 1, 2, 4 and 24 hrs of stimulation.  The peptide significantly inhibited the expression of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory genes regulated by NF-kappa B, such as NF-kappa B1 (p105/p50) and TNF-alpha-induced protein 2 (TNFAIP2).  In contrast, LL-37 did not significantly inhibit LPS-induced genes that antagonize inflammation, such as TNF-alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) and the NF-kappa B inhibitor, NF-kappa BIA, or genes involved in cell movement and recruitment (chemokines).  The trends of gene expression were further validated by quantitative real-time PCR.  This study implicates that LL-37 plays a role in the delicate balancing act of inflammatory responses.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Human monocytic cells, THP-1, were obtained from American type culture collection, ATCC® (TIB-202) and were grown in suspension in RPMI-1640 media (Gibco®, Invitrogen Life technologies, Burlington, ON), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (all from Invitrogen Life Technologies).  Cultures were maintained at 37  degree Celcius in a humidified 5% (v/v) CO2 incubator up to a maximum of six passages.  THP-1 cells at a density of 1 x 106 cells /ml were treated with 0.3 ug/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich Canada, Oakville ON) for 24 hrs, inducing plastic-adherent (primed) cells that were further rested in complete RPMI-1640 medium for an additional 24 hrs prior to stimulations with various treatments.  All experiments using human THP-1 (primed) cells were done for at least three biological replicates with two technical replicates each. 
 Sample Processing - LPS was isolated from P. aeruginosa H103 using the Darveau-Hancock method as previously described*.  Briefly, P. aeruginosa was grown overnight in LB broth at 37ºC.  Cells were collected, washed and the isolated LPS pellets were back extracted with a 2:1 chloroform:methanol solution to remove contaminating lipids.  Purified LPS were further quantitated using an assay for 2-keto-3-deoxyoctosonic acid (KDO assay) and then resuspended in endotoxin-free water (Sigma-Aldrich).  The cationic peptide, human LL-37 (LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFFRNLVPRTES), was synthesized using F-moc chemistry at the Nucleic Acid/Protein Synthesis Unit, University of British Columbia (Vancouver, BC, Canada).  The synthetic peptide was re-suspended in endotoxin-free water and stored at -20 degree Celcius until further use.  Primed THP-1 cells were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) in the absence of LL-37 (20 ug/ml) for 24 hours. &lt;br> * Darveau, RP and Hancock, REW.

 Hybridization -  Hybridization using Jack Bell 21K Human Microarray slides&lt;br> &lt;br> a. Pre-hybridization and pretreatment of slides:&lt;br> &lt;br> i. Prepare 500 ml pre-Hybridization Solution in MilliQ water as follows:&lt;br> &lt;br> 125 ml  20 x SSC (final conc 5X SSC)      &lt;br> 5ml 10% SDS (final conc 0.1% SDS)&lt;br> &lt;br> 1g  BSA (solid) (final conc 0.2% BSA)&lt;br> &lt;br> ii. Warm the pre-hyb solution to 37&amp;#61616;C to dissolve.&lt;br> iii. NOTE:  Use a cleaned pair of tweezers EVERY TIME you touch the slides.  Pre-hybridization buffer contains BSA and will leave a large streak down the slide, and ruin the subsequent scans.&lt;br> iv. Place slides into a clean wash vessel, pour approximately 450 ml of  pre-hyb buffer in and incubate at 48 &amp;#61616;C for 45 mins.  Make sure that the solution covers the slides.&lt;br> v. Wash the slides twice by dipping up and down around 10 times each in MilliQ water in clean wash vessels. &lt;br> vi. Wash the slides once by dipping up and down around 10 times in  RT isopropanol.&lt;br> vii. Spin dry the slides at 1,000 rpm for 5 mins at RT. &lt;br> viii. NOTE:  Make sure the slides are used within one hour of spinning dry.  Atmospheric humidity will cause problems.&lt;br> &lt;br> b.  1 mm LifterSlip cleaning (Eerie Scientific: 25X60I-2-4789)&lt;br> &lt;br> i. Dip lifter slip in clean dH2O&lt;br> ii. Dip LifterSlip in 100% EtOH&lt;br> iii. Blow dry with clean air. You may use a Kimwipe to remove any other  blotches you are unable to remove by the above method&lt;br> &lt;br> Hybridization&lt;br> &lt;br> i. After analyzing your labeled samples by absorbance, take 20 pmol of Cy3-labelled sample and 20 pmol of Cy5-labelled sample and combine the samples to be hybridized on one slide together.  &lt;br> ii. Add 1 µl GFP labeled probe.&lt;br> iii. Speed vac the samples, DO NOT OVERDRY, try to leave around 1-2 &amp;#61549;l in the tube (dried nucleic acids dissolve poorly in hybridization buffer). In case the sample goes completely dry add 1  2 &amp;#61549;l NF- water to the pellet and tap and re-suspend.  &lt;br> iv. Make up hybridization solution master mix for all the slides. &lt;br> v. For each 80 &amp;#61549;l hybridization solution add the following in the master mix: &lt;br> &lt;br> 72.8 &amp;#61549;l DIG Easy hyb solution&lt;br> 3.6 &amp;#61549;l salmon sperm DNA (10 mg/ml)[Ambion]&lt;br> 3.6 &amp;#61549;l tRNA (10 mg/ml) [Ambion]&lt;br> 0.28 &amp;#61549;l poly dA (1 &amp;#61549;g/ml) [Ambion]&lt;br> Dry down 8&amp;#61549;g of human cot-1 DNA [Invitrogen, catalog # 15279-011]  and resuspend in the above mix&lt;br> &lt;br> [If you want more volume of hyb buffer / slide depending on slide, keep the ratios of the components consistent]&lt;br>  &lt;br> vi. Add 80 &amp;#61549;l of the hybridization buffer to each tube with the speed vac-concentrated samples. &lt;br> vii. Mix the sample with the hybridization buffer and denature the sample at 90&amp;#61616;C for 1 min.&lt;br> viii. Keep the sample on ice for at least 1 min.&lt;br> ix. Remove it from ice, spin down quickly using table top microcentrifuge and keep samples covered from light at RT or warmer until ready to put on slide.&lt;br> x. Place the pretreated cover slips on slides, one at a time&lt;br> xi. Pipet all of the sample onto the spotted side of the pretreated slide under the short side of the lifter slip. Wait until the sample reaches the far side of the lifterslip and if required inject the last 5 -10 &amp;#61549;l of the sample under the far side of the lifterslip. [NOTE: Keep in mind the spotted side of the slide with respect to the barcode]&lt;br> xii. Place the slide in a corning cassette with 10 &amp;#61549;l NF-H2O in each well of the cassette and close.&lt;br> xiii. Seal Hybridization Chamber.  Incubate on a level surface in a humidified chamber at 37°C for at least  overnight (18 hrs).&lt;br> &lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br>  Washing&lt;br> &lt;br> i. Immerse the pair of slides in 1 X SSC and slide the arrays past one another.  NOTE: wash forceps in 70% EtOH between samples and between the various steps to reduce streaking.&lt;br> ii. Pre-warm 1 X SSC / 0.1 % SDS at 37 &amp;#61616;C, wash the slides twice for 5 mins each at 37°C in pre-warmed 1X SSC / 0.1% SDS with gentle occasional agitation ( make one litre of 1XSSC/0.1% SDS and incubate at 37°C to pre-warm it overnight)&lt;br> iii. &lt;br> 1 L of 1X SSC/ 0.1% SDS&lt;br> &lt;br> 20 X SSC 50ml&lt;br> 10% SDS 10ml&lt;br> MQ Water 940 ml&lt;br> &lt;br> iv. Wash the slides in 1X SSC for 3 mins followed by wash in 0.1X SSC for 3 mins to completely remove the SDS.&lt;br> &lt;br> 1000 ml of 1X SSC  500 ml of 0.1X SSC&lt;br> &lt;br> 20X SSC  50ml             20X SSC  2.5ml&lt;br> MQ Water  950 ml  MQ Water  997.5ml&lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br> v. Place the slides in a 50 ml falcon tube, DO NOT PLACE LID ON THE TUBE.  Keep some kimwipe on the bottom of the tube, place barcode facing the bottom of the tube and place in centrifuge with barcode facing out.&lt;br> vi. Spin dry the slides at 1,000 rpm for 5 min in room temp in the 50 ml tube.&lt;br> vii. Store the slides in dark before scanning and analysis.&lt;br>
 Labeling - In this protocol we use the Ambion kit # 1751, MessageAmp II which amplifies RNA producing aRNA ( cRNA).  This aRNA is hybridized to the 21 K slides purchased from Jack Bell Research Centre.&lt;br> &lt;br> Important Parameters for Successful Amplification&lt;br> &lt;br> Input RNA quantity and IVT reaction incubation Time&lt;br> &lt;br> Consider both the amount of sample RNA you have, and the amount of aRNA needed for your experiments when planning MessageAmp II experiments. These factors will influence how much input RNA is used, whether one or two rounds of amplification should be done, and how long to incubate the IVT reaction.&lt;br> &lt;br> Accurate quantification&lt;br> &lt;br> For experiments where the aRNA yield from different samples will be compared, it is&lt;br> Essential to accurately quantify the input RNA used in the MessageAmp II procedure. &lt;br> &lt;br> Recommended minimum and maximum amounts of input RNA&lt;br> &lt;br> Table 1 shows the mass of total RNA that can be used in the MessageAmp II aRNA procedure. Alternatively 10100 ng of poly(A) selected RNA can be used in the procedure. RNA must be in a maximum volume of 11 µl.&lt;br> &lt;br> Table 1: Amount of Total RNA to use in MessageAmp II.&lt;br> &lt;br> Amplification Recommended Minimum  Maximum&lt;br> Single Round 1000 ng 100 ng 5000 ng&lt;br> Two Rounds 100 ng 0.1 ng 100 ng&lt;br> &lt;br> RNA amount and IVT reaction incubation time&lt;br> &lt;br> The MessageAmp II procedure can accommodate a wide range of input RNA amounts, but for reproducible and comparable results, use a fixed amount of RNA for all experiments. Tailor both the amount of input RNA used and the amplification procedure to produce the amount of aRNA needed for your microarray hybridizations. For instance, Affymetrix GeneChips require 1015 µg of aRNA for each hybridization, but other commercial and core facility arrays may require slightly more or less aRNA.&lt;br> Figure 3 shows aRNA yields from different amounts of Control RNA amplified with increasing IVT incubation times. When amplifying small RNA samples however, (e.g. ~250 ng or less) incubating the IVT reaction for 14 hr will maximize the amount of aRNA produced.&lt;br> Typically 100 ng of total RNA input is the lower limit for synthesizing ~10 µg of aRNA using a 4 hr IVT reaction. If your total RNA samples will be ~100 ng or less, we advise conducting a preliminary amplification from a representative sample to determine empirically how much aRNA you can expect from your experimental samples. If the preliminary experiment does not produce enough aRNA for two array hybridizations, repeat the experiment using an IVT incubation as long as 14 hr, and/or consider using two rounds of amplification.&lt;br> &lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br> RNA Purity&lt;br> &lt;br> The single most important factor affecting how efficiently an RNA sample will be amplified using the MessageAmp II aRNA Kit is the quality of the RNA. RNA samples should be free of contaminating proteins, DNA, and other cellular material as well as phenol, ethanol, and salts associated with RNA isolation procedures.&lt;br> Impurities can lower the efficiency of reverse transcription and subsequently reduce the level of amplification. An effective measure of RNA purity is the ratio of absorbance readings at 260 and 280 nm. The ratio of A260 to A280 values should fall in the range of 1.72.1. RNA must be suspended in high quality water or TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA).&lt;br> &lt;br> RNA integrity&lt;br> The integrity of the RNA sample, or the proportion that is full-length, is another important component of RNA quality. Reverse transcribing partially degraded mRNAs will typically generate relatively short cDNAs that lack the sequence encoded upstream of the break in the RNA molecule.&lt;br> There are currently no quantitative methods for measuring what percentage of mRNAs in a sample are full-length, however several procedures do exist for establishing the relative integrity of a sample. A method that requires only nanogram quantities of RNA is microfluidic sample analysis using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and an RNA LabChip®&lt;br> Kit. The bioanalyzer fractionates RNA molecules according to size, so that the amounts&lt;br> of 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) can be determined. Primarily full-length RNA will exhibit a ratio of 28S to 18S rRNA bands that approaches 2:1.&lt;br> Denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and nucleic acid staining can also be used to separate and visualize the major rRNA species. When the RNA resolves into discrete rRNA bands (i.e. no significant smearing below each band), with the 28S rRNA band appearing approximately twice as intense as the 18S rRNA band, then the mRNA in the sample is likely to be mostly full-length. The primary drawback to gel electrophoresis is that  microgram amounts of RNA must be sacrificed.&lt;br> &lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br> Reaction Incubation times should be precise and consistent&lt;br> &lt;br> The incubation times in the protocol were optimized in conjunction with the kit reagents to ensure the maximum yield of nucleic acid product in each stepadhere to them closely.&lt;br> A range of 414 hr is given for the IVT reaction incubation time (step II.F.3 on page 13). Refer to the graph in Figure 3 on page 7 to help determine what incubation time to use. Keep this IVT incubation time uniform if aRNA yield from different samples will be compared, or if you want to have equal amplification of different samples. Although differences in IVT incubation time among samples has had very little, if any, effect on array results in our hands, we still recommend using a uniform IVT incubation time for the most reproducible amplification and array analysis.&lt;br> &lt;br> Master Mixes&lt;br> &lt;br> We strongly recommend preparing master mixes for the MessageAmp II procedure. This approach reduces the effects of pipetting error, and improves reproducibility. Using Master Mixes is especially important when aRNA yield from different samples will be compared.  Ambion provides a web-based Master Mix calculator at the following address: &lt;br> &lt;br> www.ambion.com/techlib/append/msgamp2_mm_calc.php&lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br> Thorough mixing is very important for reproducibility&lt;br> &lt;br> Below are specific instructions for mixing kit reagents, Master Mixes, and individual reactions. For maximum reproducibility and aRNA yield, follow these instructions closely. &lt;br>  Mix each kit component after thawing.&lt;br> &lt;br> Mix enzyme solutions by gently flicking the tube a few times before adding them to reactions. Thaw frozen reagents completely at room temperature (i.e. primers, nucleotides and 10 X buffers), then mix thoroughly by vortexing, and keep on ice before use.&lt;br>  Mix Master Mixes by gentle vortexing.&lt;br> &lt;br> After assembling Master Mixes, gently vortex to make a homogenous mixture without inactivating the enzyme(s).&lt;br> &lt;br>  Mix individual reactions by pipetting up and down 23 times, then flicking the tube 34 times, and finally spinning briefly.&lt;br> After adding Master Mixes or other reagents to individual reactions, pipet up and down 23 times to rinse reagents from the pipet tip. Then flick the tube with your finger 34 times to mix thoroughly, and finish by centrifuging briefly to collect the reaction at the bottom of the tube. &lt;br> &lt;br> Incubator recommendations&lt;br> &lt;br>  We recommend a calibrated hybridization oven or incubator (at constant temperature) for most of the MessageAmp II incubations.&lt;br> To avoid any potential influence on the reaction temperature from the tube holder, let tube holders equilibrate in the incubator for sufficient time, or use a tube holder that doesnt touch the sides and bottoms of the tubesfor example a floating tube support.&lt;br> &lt;br>  For the 16°C second strand synthesis reaction incubation (step II.D.2&lt;br> on page 11), we recommend using a thermal cycler&lt;br> . Ideally these reactions should be incubated in a calibrated thermal cycler with a lid temperature that matches the block temperature. Most machines do not have this feature, so if the lid temperature is static (~100°C), use it with the heat turned off, or do not use the heated lid at all. Otherwise heat from the lid will raise the temperature of the solution in the tube, compromising the reaction.&lt;br>  We do not recommend using heat blocks or water baths for MessageAmp II reaction incubations.&lt;br> The MessageAmp II procedure is very sensitive to temperature; therefore use incubators that have been professionally calibrated according the manufacturers recommended schedule. Variable or inaccurate incubation temperatures can limit aRNA synthesis. Preheat incubators if necessary so that the correct temperature has stabilized before reactions are placed in the incubator. It is also very important that condensation does&lt;br> not form in the reaction tubes during any of the incubations. Condensation changes the composition of reaction mixtures, and we have seen that it can greatly reduce yield.&lt;br> &lt;br> Maintaining consistency&lt;br> &lt;br> Procedural consistency is very important for planning amplification experiments. Consider implementing a detailed procedural plan that will be used by everyone in the lab to maintain consistency. This type of plan will minimize variation due to subtle procedural differences that can influence RNA amplification, and which may&lt;br> complicate gene expression studies. The plan should include basic information such as the method of RNA isolation, the amount of RNA to use in the procedure, and how long to incubate the IVT reaction. It should also address specifics that are not often included in protocols such as which tubes, tube racks, and incubators to use for each step in the process. Finally, develop a consistent work flow, for example standardize stopping points in the method. The idea is to standardize all of the variables discussed in this section of the Instruction Manual and carefully follow all the protocol steps in order to maximize amplification consistency among samples.&lt;br> &lt;br> Prepare the Wash Buffer&lt;br> &lt;br> Add 24 ml ACS grade 100% ethanol (ACS grade or better) to the bottle labeled aRNA Wash Buffer.

Place the tubes in a 16°C thermal cycler. It is important to cool the thermal cycler block to 16°C before adding the reaction tubes because subjecting the reactions to temperatures >16°C will compromise aRNA yield.&lt;br> 2. Incubate 2 hr at 16°C&lt;br>  Incubate 2 hr in a 16°C thermal cycler. If the lid temperature cannot be adjusted to match the 16°C block temperature, cover the reactions with the heated lid turned off, or if the lid cannot be turned offdo not cover the tubes with it. (Do not use a water bath or a heat block in a 4°C refrigerator for this incubation because the temperature will fluctuate too much.)&lt;br> &lt;br> 3. Place reactions on ice briefly or freeze immediately&lt;br> &lt;br> After the 2 hr incubation at 16°C, place the reactions on ice and proceed to. cDNA Purification (below), or immediately freeze reactions at 20°C. Do not leave the reactions on ice for long periods of time.&lt;br> This is a potential overnight stopping point, but it is better to complete the cDNA purification (next section) before stopping.&lt;br> &lt;br> cDNA Purification&lt;br> cDNA Filter Cartridges should not be subjected to RCFs over 16,000 x g because it could cause mechanical damage and/or may deposit glass filter fiber in the eluate.  All centrifugations in this purification procedure should be done at 10,000 x g (typically ~10,000 rpm) at room temp.&lt;br> &lt;br> 1. Preheat Nuclease-free Water to 5055°C&lt;br> Before beginning the cDNA purification, preheat the 10 ml bottle of Nuclease-free Water to 5055°C for at least 10 min.&lt;br> Preheat the Nuclease-free Water to a maximum of 55°C; temperatures above 58°C can partially denature the cDNA, compromising final yield of aRNA.&lt;br> &lt;br> 2. Add 250 µl cDNA Binding Buffer to each sample&lt;br> Add 250 µl of cDNA Binding Buffer to each sample from step D.2 on page 11, and mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down 23 times, then flicking the tube 34 times. Follow up with a quick spin to collect the reaction in the bottom of the tube. Proceed quickly to the next step.&lt;br> &lt;br> 3. Pass the mixture through a cDNA Filter Cartridge&lt;br> Before using them, check each cDNA Filter Cartridge to make sure that the filters are flush against the bottom of the mini-column; push them into place with the wide end of a pipet tip if necessary. Also check that the cDNA Filter Cartridge is firmly seated in its wash tube (supplied).&lt;br> a. Pipet the cDNA sample\cDNA Binding Buffer (from step 2) onto the center of the cDNA Filter Cartridge.&lt;br> b. Centrifuge for ~1 min at 10,000 x g, or until the mixture is through the filter.&lt;br> c. Discard the flow-through and replace the cDNA Filter Cartridge in the wash tube.&lt;br> Make sure that the ethanol has been added to the bottle of Wash Buffer before using it in the next step.&lt;br> &lt;br> 4. Wash with 500 µl Wash Buffer&lt;br> &lt;br> Prepare the Wash Buffer&lt;br> Add 24 ml ACS grade 100% ethanol (ACS grade or better) to the bottle labeled aRNA Wash Buffer. Mix well and mark the label to indicate that the ethanol was added.&lt;br> &lt;br> a. Apply 500 µl cDNA Wash Buffer to each cDNA Filter Cartridge.&lt;br> b. Centrifuge for ~1 min at 10,000 X g, or until all the cDNA Wash Buffer is through the filter.&lt;br> c. Discard the flow-through and spin the cDNA Filter Cartridge for an additional minute to remove trace amounts of ethanol.&lt;br> d. Transfer cDNA Filter Cartridge to a cDNA Elution Tube.&lt;br> &lt;br> 5. Elute cDNA with 2 X 9.0 µl 5055°C Nuclease-free Water&lt;br> It is important to use Nuclease-free Water that is at 5055°C for the cDNA elution. Colder water will be less efficient at eluting the cDNA, and hotter water (&amp;#8805;&amp;#2265;58°C) may result in reduced aRNA yield.&lt;br> &lt;br> a. Apply 9.0 µl of Nuclease-free Water (preheated to 5055°C) to the center of the filter in the cDNA Filter Cartridge.&lt;br> b. Leave at room temperature for 2 min and then centrifuge for ~1.5 min at 10,000 x g, or until all the Nuclease-free Water is through the filter.&lt;br> c.

If so re-dissolve by warming at room temperature and keep at room temperature until used.&lt;br> &lt;br> Preparation before procedure &lt;br> 1. Lysis buffer: Buffer RLT + beta-ME beta-mercaptoethanol). Add 10 ul beta-ME per 1ml buffer RLT before use. &lt;br> 2. Calculate the total volume of RLT buffer required and add appropriate amount of beta-ME.&lt;br> 3. Add x 4 volumes of ethanol to Buffer RPE (as indicated on the bottle of the buffer), to obtain a working solution.&lt;br> 4. For the on-column DNase digestion with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen cat # 79254), prepare a DNase I stock solution by dissolving solid DNase I (1500 Kunitz units) in 550 ul RNase free-H2O provided in the kit. Mix gently by inverting the tube. DO NOT VORTEX. For long term storage, make single use (40 ul / tube; for 4 reactions) aliquots and store them at -20 C for up to 9 months. DO NOT FREEZE THAW. Before use thaw and DO NOT CENTRIFUGE.&lt;br> 5. NOTE: there are collection tubes of two different volumes; 1.5 ml for elution and 2 ml for all other steps.&lt;br> &lt;br> Procedure&lt;br> 1. Remove tissue culture supernatant from the adherent cells, save the supernatant at - 20C for further analysis.&lt;br> 2. Wash the adherent cells with 10 ml PBS once. &lt;br> 3. Just before you are ready to process the cells, remove the PBS and add 1.2 ml lysis buffer and scrape the cells using a cell scrapper. &lt;br> 4. Pipette 600 ul cell suspension into each of two Eppendorf tubes and vortex these samples.&lt;br> 5. Add 600 ul of 70% ethanol to the suspension, mix well by pipetting. DO NOT CENTRIFUGE. NOTE: A visible precipitate may form after the addition of ethanol; this will not affect the isolation procedure.&lt;br> 6.

      <name>Transcription profiling of Bos taurus surgical model of the jejunum infected with Bovine rotavirus (BRV) and bovine coronavirus (BCV)</name>
      <description>Bovine rotavirus (BRV) and bovine coronavirus (BCV) infect intestinal villous epithelium in young cattle. A surgical model was adapted for neonatal calves in which a region of the jejunum was isolated from the digestive tract but lymph drainage, enervation and blood flow were maintained. Replicate sections of intestine (loops) were infected with either BRV or BCV and adjacent segments were injected with phosphate-buffered saline. Tissues were collected 18 hours post-infection. Four animals were used for BRV infection studies, and three animals were used for BCV infection studies. Microarray analyses provided a global evaluation of host gene expression patterns following BRV and BCV infection and changes in gene expression were  validated by qRT-PCR analyses.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Sample Processing - Briefly, a 2-3 m section of jejunum was transected and isolated from the functional digestive tract without compromising the mesenteric attachment or altering intestinal contents. The continuity of the remaining digestive tract was re-established by end-to-end anastomoses and the isolated section of jejunum was closed at both ends by inversion sutures. This section was sub-divided using silk ligatures into 10-15 cm long segments, designated as loops and each loop was separated by 15-70 cm long interspaces. These titrations were performed over a 20-fold range (50-1000 µL of stock virus) using field isolate BCV (85-189 Corona) diluted to a total volume of 5 mL with calcium and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline, (PBS) [0.137 M NaCl (Sigma- Aldrich Canada Ltd., Oakville, ON, Canada), 2.7 mM KCl (Sigma-Aldrich), 8 mM Na2HPO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), 1.47 mM KH2PO4 (Sigma-Aldrich) ; pH 7.3] and injected into duplicate loops. &lt;br> &lt;br> Duplicate control loops were mock-infected with 5 mL of PBS for a total of at least four infected loops and two control loops/animal. Three animals were used for BCV infection studies. Calves were treated post-surgery with enrofloxacin (Baytril, Bayer Inc. Animal Health, Toronto, ON, Canada) and flunixine meglumine (Cronyxin, Bioniche Animal Health Canada, Belleville, ON, Canada) and euthanized 18 h post- infection. Intestinal contents were collected from each intestinal loop at the time of tissue collection and the total volume of fluid/loop was recorded. Tissue infected with 1 mL of BCV stock and their respective animal matched PBS control loops were used for microarray analysis and these tissues were collected immediately following euthanasia, rinsed in PBS, and stored in RNAlater (Ambion, Inc. Austin, TX, USA) for 24 hours at room temperature before being frozen at 20°C to preserve the RNA integrity.&lt;br>

 Hybridization - Hybridization using Jack Bell 21K Human Microarray slides &lt;br> &lt;br> Pre-hybridization and pretreatment of slides: &lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br> i. Prepare 500 ml pre-Hybridization Solution in MilliQ water as follows: 125 ml 20 x SSC (final conc 5X SSC) 5ml 10% SDS (final conc 0.1% SDS) 1g BSA (solid) (final conc 0.2% BSA) &lt;br> &lt;br> ii. Warm the pre-hyb solution to 37 degree Celsius to dissolve. &lt;br> &lt;br> iii. NOTE: Use a cleaned pair of tweezers every time you touch the slides. Pre-hybridization buffer contains BSA and will leave a large streak down the slide, and ruin the subsequent scans. &lt;br> &lt;br> iv. Place slides into a clean wash vessel, pour approximately 450 ml of pre-hyb buffer in and incubate at 48 degree Celsius  for 45 mins. Make sure that the solution covers the slides. &lt;br> &lt;br> v. Wash the slides twice by dipping up and down around 10 times each in MilliQ water in clean wash vessels. &lt;br> &lt;br> vi. Wash the slides once by dipping up and down around 10 times in room temperature isopropanol. &lt;br> &lt;br> vii. Spin dry the slides at 1,000 rpm for 5 mins at room temperature. &lt;br> &lt;br> viii. NOTE: Make sure the slides are used within one hour of spinning dry. Atmospheric humidity will cause problems. b. 1 mm &lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br> LifterSlip cleaning (Eerie Scientific: 25X60I-2-4789) &lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br> i.

You may use a Kimwipe to remove any other blotches you are unable to remove by the above method &lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br> Hybridization &lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br> i. After analyzing your labeled samples by absorbance, take 20 pmol of Cy3-labelled sample and 20 pmol of Cy5-labelled sample and combine the samples to be hybridized on one slide together. &lt;br> &lt;br> ii. Add 1 ul GFP labeled probe. &lt;br> &lt;br> iii. Speed vac the samples, do not overdry, try to leave around 1-2 ul  in the tube (dried nucleic acids dissolve poorly in hybridization buffer). In case the sample goes completely dry add 1 - 2 ul  nuclease free water to the pellet and tap and re-suspend. &lt;br> &lt;br> iv. Make up hybridization solution master mix for all the slides. &lt;br> &lt;br> v.

 Labeling - In this protocol we use the Ambion kit # 1751, MessageAmp II which amplifies RNA producing aRNA ( cRNA).  This aRNA is hybridized to the 21 K slides purchased from Jack Bell Research Centre.&lt;br> &lt;br> Important Parameters for Successful Amplification&lt;br> &lt;br> Input RNA quantity and IVT reaction incubation Time&lt;br> &lt;br> Consider both the amount of sample RNA you have, and the amount of aRNA needed for your experiments when planning MessageAmp II experiments. These factors will influence how much input RNA is used, whether one or two rounds of amplification should be done, and how long to incubate the IVT reaction.&lt;br> &lt;br> Accurate quantification&lt;br> &lt;br> For experiments where the aRNA yield from different samples will be compared, it is&lt;br> Essential to accurately quantify the input RNA used in the MessageAmp II procedure. &lt;br> &lt;br> Recommended minimum and maximum amounts of input RNA&lt;br> &lt;br> Table 1 shows the mass of total RNA that can be used in the MessageAmp II aRNA procedure. Alternatively 10100 ng of poly(A) selected RNA can be used in the procedure. RNA must be in a maximum volume of 11 µl.&lt;br> &lt;br> Table 1: Amount of Total RNA to use in MessageAmp II.&lt;br> &lt;br> Amplification Recommended Minimum  Maximum&lt;br> Single Round 1000 ng 100 ng 5000 ng&lt;br> Two Rounds 100 ng 0.1 ng 100 ng&lt;br> &lt;br> RNA amount and IVT reaction incubation time&lt;br> &lt;br> The MessageAmp II procedure can accommodate a wide range of input RNA amounts, but for reproducible and comparable results, use a fixed amount of RNA for all experiments. Tailor both the amount of input RNA used and the amplification procedure to produce the amount of aRNA needed for your microarray hybridizations. For instance, Affymetrix GeneChips require 1015 µg of aRNA for each hybridization, but other commercial and core facility arrays may require slightly more or less aRNA.&lt;br> Figure 3 shows aRNA yields from different amounts of Control RNA amplified with increasing IVT incubation times. When amplifying small RNA samples however, (e.g. ~250 ng or less) incubating the IVT reaction for 14 hr will maximize the amount of aRNA produced.&lt;br> Typically 100 ng of total RNA input is the lower limit for synthesizing ~10 µg of aRNA using a 4 hr IVT reaction. If your total RNA samples will be ~100 ng or less, we advise conducting a preliminary amplification from a representative sample to determine empirically how much aRNA you can expect from your experimental samples. If the preliminary experiment does not produce enough aRNA for two array hybridizations, repeat the experiment using an IVT incubation as long as 14 hr, and/or consider using two rounds of amplification.&lt;br> &lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br> RNA Purity&lt;br> &lt;br> The single most important factor affecting how efficiently an RNA sample will be amplified using the MessageAmp II aRNA Kit is the quality of the RNA. RNA samples should be free of contaminating proteins, DNA, and other cellular material as well as phenol, ethanol, and salts associated with RNA isolation procedures.&lt;br> Impurities can lower the efficiency of reverse transcription and subsequently reduce the level of amplification. An effective measure of RNA purity is the ratio of absorbance readings at 260 and 280 nm. The ratio of A260 to A280 values should fall in the range of 1.72.1. RNA must be suspended in high quality water or TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA).&lt;br> &lt;br> RNA integrity&lt;br> The integrity of the RNA sample, or the proportion that is full-length, is another important component of RNA quality. Reverse transcribing partially degraded mRNAs will typically generate relatively short cDNAs that lack the sequence encoded upstream of the break in the RNA molecule.&lt;br> There are currently no quantitative methods for measuring what percentage of mRNAs in a sample are full-length, however several procedures do exist for establishing the relative integrity of a sample. A method that requires only nanogram quantities of RNA is microfluidic sample analysis using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and an RNA LabChip®&lt;br> Kit. The bioanalyzer fractionates RNA molecules according to size, so that the amounts&lt;br> of 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) can be determined. Primarily full-length RNA will exhibit a ratio of 28S to 18S rRNA bands that approaches 2:1.&lt;br> Denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and nucleic acid staining can also be used to separate and visualize the major rRNA species. When the RNA resolves into discrete rRNA bands (i.e. no significant smearing below each band), with the 28S rRNA band appearing approximately twice as intense as the 18S rRNA band, then the mRNA in the sample is likely to be mostly full-length. The primary drawback to gel electrophoresis is that  microgram amounts of RNA must be sacrificed.&lt;br> &lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br> Reaction Incubation times should be precise and consistent&lt;br> &lt;br> The incubation times in the protocol were optimized in conjunction with the kit reagents to ensure the maximum yield of nucleic acid product in each stepadhere to them closely.&lt;br> A range of 414 hr is given for the IVT reaction incubation time (step II.F.3 on page 13). Refer to the graph in Figure 3 on page 7 to help determine what incubation time to use. Keep this IVT incubation time uniform if aRNA yield from different samples will be compared, or if you want to have equal amplification of different samples. Although differences in IVT incubation time among samples has had very little, if any, effect on array results in our hands, we still recommend using a uniform IVT incubation time for the most reproducible amplification and array analysis.&lt;br> &lt;br> Master Mixes&lt;br> &lt;br> We strongly recommend preparing master mixes for the MessageAmp II procedure. This approach reduces the effects of pipetting error, and improves reproducibility. Using Master Mixes is especially important when aRNA yield from different samples will be compared.  Ambion provides a web-based Master Mix calculator at the following address: &lt;br> &lt;br> www.ambion.com/techlib/append/msgamp2_mm_calc.php&lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br> Thorough mixing is very important for reproducibility&lt;br> &lt;br> Below are specific instructions for mixing kit reagents, Master Mixes, and individual reactions. For maximum reproducibility and aRNA yield, follow these instructions closely. &lt;br>  Mix each kit component after thawing.&lt;br> &lt;br> Mix enzyme solutions by gently flicking the tube a few times before adding them to reactions. Thaw frozen reagents completely at room temperature (i.e. primers, nucleotides and 10 X buffers), then mix thoroughly by vortexing, and keep on ice before use.&lt;br>  Mix Master Mixes by gentle vortexing.&lt;br> &lt;br> After assembling Master Mixes, gently vortex to make a homogenous mixture without inactivating the enzyme(s).&lt;br> &lt;br>  Mix individual reactions by pipetting up and down 23 times, then flicking the tube 34 times, and finally spinning briefly.&lt;br> After adding Master Mixes or other reagents to individual reactions, pipet up and down 23 times to rinse reagents from the pipet tip. Then flick the tube with your finger 34 times to mix thoroughly, and finish by centrifuging briefly to collect the reaction at the bottom of the tube. &lt;br> &lt;br> Incubator recommendations&lt;br> &lt;br>  We recommend a calibrated hybridization oven or incubator (at constant temperature) for most of the MessageAmp II incubations.&lt;br> To avoid any potential influence on the reaction temperature from the tube holder, let tube holders equilibrate in the incubator for sufficient time, or use a tube holder that doesnt touch the sides and bottoms of the tubesfor example a floating tube support.&lt;br> &lt;br>  For the 16°C second strand synthesis reaction incubation (step II.D.2&lt;br> on page 11), we recommend using a thermal cycler&lt;br> . Ideally these reactions should be incubated in a calibrated thermal cycler with a lid temperature that matches the block temperature. Most machines do not have this feature, so if the lid temperature is static (~100°C), use it with the heat turned off, or do not use the heated lid at all. Otherwise heat from the lid will raise the temperature of the solution in the tube, compromising the reaction.&lt;br>  We do not recommend using heat blocks or water baths for MessageAmp II reaction incubations.&lt;br> The MessageAmp II procedure is very sensitive to temperature; therefore use incubators that have been professionally calibrated according the manufacturers recommended schedule. Variable or inaccurate incubation temperatures can limit aRNA synthesis. Preheat incubators if necessary so that the correct temperature has stabilized before reactions are placed in the incubator. It is also very important that condensation does&lt;br> not form in the reaction tubes during any of the incubations. Condensation changes the composition of reaction mixtures, and we have seen that it can greatly reduce yield.&lt;br> &lt;br> Maintaining consistency&lt;br> &lt;br> Procedural consistency is very important for planning amplification experiments. Consider implementing a detailed procedural plan that will be used by everyone in the lab to maintain consistency. This type of plan will minimize variation due to subtle procedural differences that can influence RNA amplification, and which may&lt;br> complicate gene expression studies. The plan should include basic information such as the method of RNA isolation, the amount of RNA to use in the procedure, and how long to incubate the IVT reaction. It should also address specifics that are not often included in protocols such as which tubes, tube racks, and incubators to use for each step in the process. Finally, develop a consistent work flow, for example standardize stopping points in the method. The idea is to standardize all of the variables discussed in this section of the Instruction Manual and carefully follow all the protocol steps in order to maximize amplification consistency among samples.&lt;br> &lt;br> Prepare the Wash Buffer&lt;br> &lt;br> Add 24 ml ACS grade 100% ethanol (ACS grade or better) to the bottle labeled aRNA Wash Buffer.

Place the tubes in a 16°C thermal cycler. It is important to cool the thermal cycler block to 16°C before adding the reaction tubes because subjecting the reactions to temperatures >16°C will compromise aRNA yield.&lt;br> 2. Incubate 2 hr at 16°C&lt;br>  Incubate 2 hr in a 16°C thermal cycler. If the lid temperature cannot be adjusted to match the 16°C block temperature, cover the reactions with the heated lid turned off, or if the lid cannot be turned offdo not cover the tubes with it. (Do not use a water bath or a heat block in a 4°C refrigerator for this incubation because the temperature will fluctuate too much.)&lt;br> &lt;br> 3. Place reactions on ice briefly or freeze immediately&lt;br> &lt;br> After the 2 hr incubation at 16°C, place the reactions on ice and proceed to. cDNA Purification (below), or immediately freeze reactions at 20°C.

Pass the mixture through a cDNA Filter Cartridge&lt;br> Before using them, check each cDNA Filter Cartridge to make sure that the filters are flush against the bottom of the mini-column; push them into place with the wide end of a pipet tip if necessary.

Transfer cDNA Filter Cartridge to a cDNA Elution Tube.&lt;br> &lt;br> 5. Elute cDNA with 2 X 9.0 µl 5055°C Nuclease-free Water&lt;br> It is important to use Nuclease-free Water that is at 5055°C for the cDNA elution. Colder water will be less efficient at eluting the cDNA, and hotter water (&amp;#8805;&amp;#2265;58°C) may result in reduced aRNA yield.&lt;br> &lt;br> a. Apply 9.0 µl of Nuclease-free Water (preheated to 5055°C) to the center of the filter in the cDNA Filter Cartridge.&lt;br> b. Leave at room temperature for 2 min and then centrifuge for ~1.5 min at 10,000 x g, or until all the Nuclease-free Water is through the filter.&lt;br> c. Elute with a second 9.0 µl of preheated Nuclease-free Water. The double-stranded cDNA will now be in the eluate (~14 µl).&lt;br> d. Proceed directly to section F.

To couple an aRNA to more than one dye, transfer the aRNA per dye to a single tube and vacuum dry to 7 µl per&lt;br> dye. &lt;br> If the heater on the vacuum centrifuge is adjustable, use the medium or low temperature setting.&lt;br> Check the progress of drying every 510 min, and remove the sample from the concentrator when it reaches the desired volume; do not overdry.&lt;br> &lt;br> NHS Ester Dye Preparation&lt;br> Prepare dye immediately before starting the dye coupling procedures. The preparation and storage of solubilized dye is important for the efficient labeling of amino allyl modified aRNA. It is imperative that the dye compounds remain&lt;br> dry both before and after dissolving in DMSO because any water that is introduced will cause hydrolysis of the NHS esters, lowering the efficiency of coupling.&lt;br> &lt;br> IMPORTANT&lt;br> Store any unused solubilized dye in the dark at 80°C. Note that most dye&lt;br> manufacturers do not recommend storing solubilized dyes for more than&lt;br> ~1 month.&lt;br> &lt;br> Amersham Biosciences FluoroLink Cy5 (PA25001) and Cy3 (PA23001) monofunctional dye 5-pack&lt;br> &lt;br> These dyes are supplied in relatively large aliquots; resuspend one dye vial in 32 µl of DMSO and keep in the dark at room temp for up to 1 hr until you are ready to use it. Molecular Probes&lt;br> &lt;br> aRNA:Dye Coupling Reaction 1. Add 9 µl Coupling Buffer to the aRNA&lt;br> To a tube containing 7 µl amino allyl aRNA (520 µg), add 9 µl Coupling Buffer and mix well.&lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br> 2. Add 3 µl prepared dye to the aRNA and mix well&lt;br> Add 3 µl of NHS ester dye in DMSO to the aRNA:Coupling Buffer&lt;br> mixture. Mix well.&lt;br> &lt;br> 3. Incubate 30 min at room temp in the dark&lt;br> This 30 min incubation at room temp allows the dye coupling reaction to occur. To keep the samples in the dark, typically it is sufficient to simply put the tubes in a closed drawer.&lt;br> &lt;br> Add 4.5 µl 4M Hydroxylamine, mix, and incubate 15 min at room temp in the dark&lt;br> To quench the reaction, add 4.5 µl 4M Hydroxylamine and mix well. Incubate the reaction at room temperature in the dark for 15 minutes.  During this incubation, the large molar excess of hydroxylamine will quench the amine-reactive groups on the unreacted dye molecules.&lt;br> &lt;br> Dye Labeled aRNA Purification&lt;br> &lt;br> Repeat the aRNA purification protocol described above using the kit Mega Clear from Ambion (Cat. # 1908).  The amplification kit comes only for 20 reactions and does not provide extra cartridges for dye-labeled aRNA purification.&lt;br> &lt;br> NOTE: Do not use Nuclease-free Water to elute.  Use the elution buffer provided in the Mega Clear kit.  &lt;br> &lt;br> This purification removes enzymes, salts and unincorporated nucleotides from the aRNA. At the end of the purification, the aRNA can be eluted from the filter with elution buffer.&lt;br> aRNA Filter Cartridges should not be subjected to RCFs over 16,000 x g because it could cause mechanical damage and/or may deposit glass filter fiber in the eluate. All centrifugations in this section should be done at 10,000 x g typically ~10,000 rpm)&lt;br> &lt;br> 1. Preheat the elution buffer to 5060°C (&amp;#8805;10 min)&lt;br> Before beginning the aRNA purification preheat the  bottle elution buffer to 5060°C for at least 10 min.&lt;br> &lt;br> 2. Assemble aRNA Filter Cartridges and tubes&lt;br> For each sample, place an aRNA Filter Cartridge into an aRNA Collection Tube, and set aside for use in step 5.&lt;br> &lt;br> 3. Add 350 µl aRNA Binding Buffer&lt;br> Check to make sure that each IVT reaction was brought to 100 µl with Nuclease-free Water.&lt;br> Add 350 µl of aRNA Binding Buffer to each aRNA sample. Proceed to the next step immediately.&lt;br> &lt;br> 4. Add 250 µl 100% ethanol and pipet 3 times to mix&lt;br> Add 250 µl of ACS grade 100% ethanol to each aRNA sample, and mix by pipetting the mixture up and down 3 times. Do NOT vortex to mix and do NOT centrifuge.&lt;br> It is crucial to follow these mixing instructions exactly, and to proceed quickly to the next step.&lt;br> Proceed immediately to the next step as soon as you have mixed the ethanol into each sample. Any delay in proceeding could result in loss of aRNA because once the ethanol is added, the aRNA will be in a semiprecipitated state.&lt;br> &lt;br> 5. Pass samples through an aRNA Filter Cartridge(s)&lt;br> a. Pipet each sample mixture from step 4 onto the center of the filter in the aRNA Filter Cartridge.&lt;br> b. Centrifuge for ~1 min at 10,000 X g. Continue until the mixture has passed through the filter.&lt;br> c. Discard the flow-through and replace the aRNA Filter Cartridge back into the aRNA Collection Tube.&lt;br> &lt;br> 6. Wash with 650 µl Wash Buffer&lt;br> a. Apply 650 µl Wash Buffer to each aRNA Filter Cartridge.&lt;br> b. Centrifuge for ~1 min at 10,000 X g, or until all the wash solution is through the filter.&lt;br> c. Discard the flow-through and spin the aRNA Filter Cartridge for an additional ~1 min to remove trace amounts of ethanol.&lt;br> d. Transfer Filter Cartridge(s) to a fresh aRNA Collection Tube.&lt;br> &lt;br> 7. Elute aRNA with 100 µL elution buffer&lt;br> a. To the center of the filter, add 100 µl elution buffer that is preheated to 5060°C.&lt;br> b. Leave at room temperature for 2 min and then centrifuge for ~1.5 min at 10,000 X g, or until the solution is through the filter.&lt;br> c. The dye-labeled aRNA will now be in the aRNA Collection Tube in ~100 µl of elution buffer.&lt;br> &lt;br>  Determining the incorporation of labeled nucleotides&lt;br> &lt;br> a. Take the 100 &amp;#61549;l sample into a disposable NF-uvette, after reading the absorbance collect the sample back with the NF-barrier microtip for further use. Be careful NOT to contaminate the sample at this point!&lt;br> b. Read the absorbance of all samples at 260 nm for quantifying RNA yield.&lt;br> c. Read absorbance of the Cy3-labelled samples at 550 nm and Cy5-labelled samples at 650 nm.  &lt;br> d. Extinction coefficients are 150,000 for Cy3 and 250,000 for Cy5 respectively.&lt;br> e. Abs (dye) / (extinction coefficient * 10^-6) = pmol dye/ &amp;#61549;l of sample.&lt;br> f. Example : If A550 = 0.25&lt;br> Then 0.25/0.15=1.67 pmol Cy3 dye / &amp;#61549;l.&lt;br> g. Consider the nucleic acid to be single for calculating the yield of RNA. Therefore, factor of 40 is approximately correct for estimating nucleic acid concentration from A260  reading.&lt;br> 
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - June 2004&lt;br> RNA isolation using RNeasy Mini Kit &lt;br> Qiagen: Cat # 74104; for 50 reactions; or Cat # 74106 for 250 reactions&lt;br>  &lt;br> PURPOSE: To permit isolation of very pure RNA for microarray and PCR amplification work.&lt;br> The procedure written below can be used for 1.5 to 2 x 107 PMA-primed, plastic-adherent THP1cells.&lt;br> &lt;br> NOTES: &lt;br> « All RNeasy protocol should be performed at room temperature (approximately 23C).&lt;br> « Buffers RLT and RW1 contain a guanidine salt and therefore are not compatible with disinfecting agents such as bleach. &lt;br> « Buffer RLT may form a precipitate. If so re-dissolve by warming at room temperature and keep at room temperature until used.&lt;br> &lt;br> Preparation before procedure &lt;br> 1. Lysis buffer: Buffer RLT + beta-ME beta-mercaptoethanol). Add 10 ul beta-ME per 1ml buffer RLT before use. &lt;br> 2. Calculate the total volume of RLT buffer required and add appropriate amount of beta-ME.&lt;br> 3. Add x 4 volumes of ethanol to Buffer RPE (as indicated on the bottle of the buffer), to obtain a working solution.&lt;br> 4. For the on-column DNase digestion with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen cat # 79254), prepare a DNase I stock solution by dissolving solid DNase I (1500 Kunitz units) in 550 ul RNase free-H2O provided in the kit. Mix gently by inverting the tube. DO NOT VORTEX. For long term storage, make single use (40 ul / tube; for 4 reactions) aliquots and store them at -20 C for up to 9 months. DO NOT FREEZE THAW. Before use thaw and DO NOT CENTRIFUGE.&lt;br> 5. NOTE: there are collection tubes of two different volumes; 1.5 ml for elution and 2 ml for all other steps.&lt;br> &lt;br> Procedure&lt;br> 1. Remove tissue culture supernatant from the adherent cells, save the supernatant at - 20C for further analysis.&lt;br> 2. Wash the adherent cells with 10 ml PBS once. &lt;br> 3. Just before you are ready to process the cells, remove the PBS and add 1.2 ml lysis buffer and scrape the cells using a cell scrapper. &lt;br> 4. Pipette 600 ul cell suspension into each of two Eppendorf tubes and vortex these samples.&lt;br> 5. Add 600 ul of 70% ethanol to the suspension, mix well by pipetting. DO NOT CENTRIFUGE. NOTE: A visible precipitate may form after the addition of ethanol; this will not affect the isolation procedure.&lt;br> 6. Apply 600 ul of sample to the RNeasy mini column placed in a 2 ml collection tube supplied with the kit (including any precipitate that is formed).&lt;br> 7. Close the tube gently, centrifuge for 15 sec at greater than 8000 x g (greater than 10,000 rpm).&lt;br> 8. Discard the flow through, reuse the collection tube, apply the rest of the sample to the mini column and repeat sample loading as in step 8.&lt;br> 9. Pipette 350 ul buffer RW1 into the mini column and centrifuge for 15 sec at greater than 8000 x g (greater than 10,000 rpm) to wash.&lt;br> 10. For each sample, add 10 ul DNase 1 stock solution to 70 ul Buffer RDD (supplied in the RNase-free DNase set; Qiagen cat # 79254). This volume supplies one reaction, so you can make appropriate amount depending on the number of reactions. Mix gently by inverting the tube.&lt;br> 11. NOTE: DNase I is especially sensitive to physical denaturation. Mixing should be carried out by gently inverting the tube. DO NOT VORTEX.&lt;br> 12. Add 80 ul of the DNase I incubation mix DIRECTLY onto the silica-gel membrane of the column and place on bench top (RT) for 15 min.&lt;br> 13. NOTE: Make sure to pipette the DNase I incubation mix DIRECTLY onto the Silica-gel of the mini column. DNase digestion will be incomplete if part of it sticks to the walls or the O-ring of the column.&lt;br> 14. Pipette 350 ul Buffer RW1 into the mini column and centrifuge for 15 sec at greater than 8000 x g (greater than 10,000 rpm), discard the flow through.&lt;br> 15. Transfer the RNeasy column to a new 2 ml collection tube, pipette 500 ul Buffer RPE onto the column, close the tube gently and centrifuge for 15 sec at greater than 8000 x g (greater than 10,000 rpm) to wash. Discard flow thru. This wash is done X 2.&lt;br> 16. After the second wash, discarding the flow through each time, gently close the tube and centrifuge for 2 min at greater than 8000 x g (greater than 10,000 rpm) to dry the RNeasy silica gel membrane.&lt;br> 17. Place the column in a new 1.5 ml collection tube for elution.&lt;br> 18. Pipette 30 ul RNase-free water directly onto the silica-gel membrane. Close the tube gently and centrifuge for 1 min at greater than 8000 x g (greater than 10,000 rpm). Repeat these elution steps twice. The total sample volume eluted from the columns will be around 60 ul.&lt;br> 19. Pool the two identical samples together, the total volume per sample will be 120 ul.&lt;br> 20. Speed vac and concentrate the sample to approximately less than one-third the volume. &lt;br> 21. NOTE: Required concentration of total RNA for microarrays cannot be less than 1 ug/ul.&lt;br> 22.

      <name>Transcription profiling of responses to TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, peptidoglycan or lipopolysaccharide (TLR2/4 agonists) evaluated at 4 hrs in peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) from the patient bearing the IRAK4 Q293X mutation vs PBM from 5 healthy individuals</name>
      <description>IL-1R associated kinase-4 (IRAK4) is a key enzyme required for activation of the common Toll-like Receptor (TLR) signaling cascade, which results in the transcription of inflammatory and immunity genes.  IRAK-4 deficiency has recently been described as a rare form of innate immunodeficiency.  Patients present with pyogenic bacterial infections and bacteraemia, particularly with Gram+ Streptococcus pneumoniae, and isolated PBMC from these patients fail to produce inflammatory cytokines in response to TLR agonists.  We embarked on this study for several purposes: (1) to identify defective gene response resulting from IRAK4-deficiency that are responsible for the patients' susceptibility to infection by particular bacteria (2) to identify genetic responses that confer relatively normal immunity in these patients despite having a defect in such a critical component of the innate immune system (3) to gain understanding of the transcriptional regulation of inflammatory genes (4) to gain insight into TLR signal transduction pathways, in particular, the role of IRAK4 in the TLR2 and TLR4 pathways initiated by Gram+ and Gram- bacterial components respectively. Transcriptional responses to TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, peptidoglycan or lipopolysaccharide (TLR2/4 agonists) were evaluated at 4 hrs in peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) from the patient bearing the IRAK4 Q293X mutation compared to PBM from 5 healthy individuals.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Venous blood (100 ml) from healthy volunteers was collected in Vacutainer collection tubes containing sodium heparin as an anticoagulant (Becton Dickinson, Mississauga, ON).  Blood was diluted 1:1 with complete RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Invitrogen Life technologies, Burlington, ON), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (all from Invitrogen Life Technologies), then separated by centrifugation over a Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) density gradient.  White blood cells were isolated from the buffy coat, washed twice in RPMI 1640 complete medium, and the number of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was determined by trypan blue exclusion.  PBMC (2 x 10^7) were seeded into 6-well tissue culture dishes (Falcon; Becton Dickinson) at 5 x 10^6 cells/ml and incubated at 37 degree Celsius in 5% CO2 for 1 hr prior to activation. 
 Sample Processing - PBMC were incubated for 4 hrs at 37 degree Celsius in 5% CO2 in 10ug/ml peptidoglycan (PGN). The reagent was tested for endotoxin and reconstituted in endotoxin-free water. Stimulation was performed using PBMC from 5 healthy adults.  PBMC were transferred to 15 ml tubes (Falcon; Becton Dickinson), using 1ml of Versene to detach adherent cells. PBMC were washed twice into PBS containing 5 mM EDTA and 2% FCS to a final concentration of  ~1 x 10^7cells/ml.  Cells were rotated end over end at 4 degree Celsius for 1 hr with 25 ul of anti-CD14 conjugated magnetic beads (M450; Dynal; Invitrogen) per ml of cells.  Beads were immobilized with a magnet (Dynal; Invitrogen) and washed 3 x 1 ml with PBS.  RNA was isolated from CD14+ PBMC with RNeasy Mini kit, treated with RNase-Free DNase (Qiagen Inc., Canada) and eluted in RNase-free water (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX, USA) as per manufacturer's instructions.  An equal quantity of RNA from each of the healthy individuals was pooled into one control sample for the microarray.
 Hybridization -  Hybridization using Jack Bell 21K Human Microarray slides&lt;br> &lt;br> a. Pre-hybridization and pretreatment of slides:&lt;br> &lt;br> i. Prepare 500 ml pre-Hybridization Solution in MilliQ water as follows:&lt;br> &lt;br> 125 ml  20 x SSC (final conc 5X SSC)      &lt;br> 5ml 10% SDS (final conc 0.1% SDS)&lt;br> &lt;br> 1g  BSA (solid) (final conc 0.2% BSA)&lt;br> &lt;br> ii. Warm the pre-hyb solution to 37&amp;#61616;C to dissolve.&lt;br> iii. NOTE:  Use a cleaned pair of tweezers EVERY TIME you touch the slides.  Pre-hybridization buffer contains BSA and will leave a large streak down the slide, and ruin the subsequent scans.&lt;br> iv. Place slides into a clean wash vessel, pour approximately 450 ml of  pre-hyb buffer in and incubate at 48 &amp;#61616;C for 45 mins.  Make sure that the solution covers the slides.&lt;br> v. Wash the slides twice by dipping up and down around 10 times each in MilliQ water in clean wash vessels. &lt;br> vi. Wash the slides once by dipping up and down around 10 times in  RT isopropanol.&lt;br> vii. Spin dry the slides at 1,000 rpm for 5 mins at RT. &lt;br> viii. NOTE:  Make sure the slides are used within one hour of spinning dry.

Remove it from ice, spin down quickly using table top microcentrifuge and keep samples covered from light at RT or warmer until ready to put on slide.&lt;br> x. Place the pretreated cover slips on slides, one at a time&lt;br> xi. Pipet all of the sample onto the spotted side of the pretreated slide under the short side of the lifter slip. Wait until the sample reaches the far side of the lifterslip and if required inject the last 5 -10 &amp;#61549;l of the sample under the far side of the lifterslip. [NOTE: Keep in mind the spotted side of the slide with respect to the barcode]&lt;br> xii. Place the slide in a corning cassette with 10 &amp;#61549;l NF-H2O in each well of the cassette and close.&lt;br> xiii. Seal Hybridization Chamber.

 Labeling - In this protocol we use the Ambion kit # 1751, MessageAmp II which amplifies RNA producing aRNA ( cRNA).  This aRNA is hybridized to the 21 K slides purchased from Jack Bell Research Centre.&lt;br> &lt;br> Important Parameters for Successful Amplification&lt;br> &lt;br> Input RNA quantity and IVT reaction incubation Time&lt;br> &lt;br> Consider both the amount of sample RNA you have, and the amount of aRNA needed for your experiments when planning MessageAmp II experiments. These factors will influence how much input RNA is used, whether one or two rounds of amplification should be done, and how long to incubate the IVT reaction.&lt;br> &lt;br> Accurate quantification&lt;br> &lt;br> For experiments where the aRNA yield from different samples will be compared, it is&lt;br> Essential to accurately quantify the input RNA used in the MessageAmp II procedure. &lt;br> &lt;br> Recommended minimum and maximum amounts of input RNA&lt;br> &lt;br> Table 1 shows the mass of total RNA that can be used in the MessageAmp II aRNA procedure. Alternatively 10100 ng of poly(A) selected RNA can be used in the procedure. RNA must be in a maximum volume of 11 µl.&lt;br> &lt;br> Table 1: Amount of Total RNA to use in MessageAmp II.&lt;br> &lt;br> Amplification Recommended Minimum  Maximum&lt;br> Single Round 1000 ng 100 ng 5000 ng&lt;br> Two Rounds 100 ng 0.1 ng 100 ng&lt;br> &lt;br> RNA amount and IVT reaction incubation time&lt;br> &lt;br> The MessageAmp II procedure can accommodate a wide range of input RNA amounts, but for reproducible and comparable results, use a fixed amount of RNA for all experiments. Tailor both the amount of input RNA used and the amplification procedure to produce the amount of aRNA needed for your microarray hybridizations. For instance, Affymetrix GeneChips require 1015 µg of aRNA for each hybridization, but other commercial and core facility arrays may require slightly more or less aRNA.&lt;br> Figure 3 shows aRNA yields from different amounts of Control RNA amplified with increasing IVT incubation times. When amplifying small RNA samples however, (e.g. ~250 ng or less) incubating the IVT reaction for 14 hr will maximize the amount of aRNA produced.&lt;br> Typically 100 ng of total RNA input is the lower limit for synthesizing ~10 µg of aRNA using a 4 hr IVT reaction. If your total RNA samples will be ~100 ng or less, we advise conducting a preliminary amplification from a representative sample to determine empirically how much aRNA you can expect from your experimental samples. If the preliminary experiment does not produce enough aRNA for two array hybridizations, repeat the experiment using an IVT incubation as long as 14 hr, and/or consider using two rounds of amplification.&lt;br> &lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br> RNA Purity&lt;br> &lt;br> The single most important factor affecting how efficiently an RNA sample will be amplified using the MessageAmp II aRNA Kit is the quality of the RNA. RNA samples should be free of contaminating proteins, DNA, and other cellular material as well as phenol, ethanol, and salts associated with RNA isolation procedures.&lt;br> Impurities can lower the efficiency of reverse transcription and subsequently reduce the level of amplification. An effective measure of RNA purity is the ratio of absorbance readings at 260 and 280 nm. The ratio of A260 to A280 values should fall in the range of 1.72.1. RNA must be suspended in high quality water or TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA).&lt;br> &lt;br> RNA integrity&lt;br> The integrity of the RNA sample, or the proportion that is full-length, is another important component of RNA quality. Reverse transcribing partially degraded mRNAs will typically generate relatively short cDNAs that lack the sequence encoded upstream of the break in the RNA molecule.&lt;br> There are currently no quantitative methods for measuring what percentage of mRNAs in a sample are full-length, however several procedures do exist for establishing the relative integrity of a sample. A method that requires only nanogram quantities of RNA is microfluidic sample analysis using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and an RNA LabChip®&lt;br> Kit. The bioanalyzer fractionates RNA molecules according to size, so that the amounts&lt;br> of 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) can be determined. Primarily full-length RNA will exhibit a ratio of 28S to 18S rRNA bands that approaches 2:1.&lt;br> Denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and nucleic acid staining can also be used to separate and visualize the major rRNA species. When the RNA resolves into discrete rRNA bands (i.e. no significant smearing below each band), with the 28S rRNA band appearing approximately twice as intense as the 18S rRNA band, then the mRNA in the sample is likely to be mostly full-length. The primary drawback to gel electrophoresis is that  microgram amounts of RNA must be sacrificed.&lt;br> &lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br> Reaction Incubation times should be precise and consistent&lt;br> &lt;br> The incubation times in the protocol were optimized in conjunction with the kit reagents to ensure the maximum yield of nucleic acid product in each stepadhere to them closely.&lt;br> A range of 414 hr is given for the IVT reaction incubation time (step II.F.3 on page 13). Refer to the graph in Figure 3 on page 7 to help determine what incubation time to use. Keep this IVT incubation time uniform if aRNA yield from different samples will be compared, or if you want to have equal amplification of different samples. Although differences in IVT incubation time among samples has had very little, if any, effect on array results in our hands, we still recommend using a uniform IVT incubation time for the most reproducible amplification and array analysis.&lt;br> &lt;br> Master Mixes&lt;br> &lt;br> We strongly recommend preparing master mixes for the MessageAmp II procedure. This approach reduces the effects of pipetting error, and improves reproducibility. Using Master Mixes is especially important when aRNA yield from different samples will be compared.  Ambion provides a web-based Master Mix calculator at the following address: &lt;br> &lt;br> www.ambion.com/techlib/append/msgamp2_mm_calc.php&lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br> Thorough mixing is very important for reproducibility&lt;br> &lt;br> Below are specific instructions for mixing kit reagents, Master Mixes, and individual reactions. For maximum reproducibility and aRNA yield, follow these instructions closely. &lt;br>  Mix each kit component after thawing.&lt;br> &lt;br> Mix enzyme solutions by gently flicking the tube a few times before adding them to reactions. Thaw frozen reagents completely at room temperature (i.e. primers, nucleotides and 10 X buffers), then mix thoroughly by vortexing, and keep on ice before use.&lt;br>  Mix Master Mixes by gentle vortexing.&lt;br> &lt;br> After assembling Master Mixes, gently vortex to make a homogenous mixture without inactivating the enzyme(s).&lt;br> &lt;br>  Mix individual reactions by pipetting up and down 23 times, then flicking the tube 34 times, and finally spinning briefly.&lt;br> After adding Master Mixes or other reagents to individual reactions, pipet up and down 23 times to rinse reagents from the pipet tip. Then flick the tube with your finger 34 times to mix thoroughly, and finish by centrifuging briefly to collect the reaction at the bottom of the tube. &lt;br> &lt;br> Incubator recommendations&lt;br> &lt;br>  We recommend a calibrated hybridization oven or incubator (at constant temperature) for most of the MessageAmp II incubations.&lt;br> To avoid any potential influence on the reaction temperature from the tube holder, let tube holders equilibrate in the incubator for sufficient time, or use a tube holder that doesnt touch the sides and bottoms of the tubesfor example a floating tube support.&lt;br> &lt;br>  For the 16°C second strand synthesis reaction incubation (step II.D.2&lt;br> on page 11), we recommend using a thermal cycler&lt;br> . Ideally these reactions should be incubated in a calibrated thermal cycler with a lid temperature that matches the block temperature. Most machines do not have this feature, so if the lid temperature is static (~100°C), use it with the heat turned off, or do not use the heated lid at all. Otherwise heat from the lid will raise the temperature of the solution in the tube, compromising the reaction.&lt;br>  We do not recommend using heat blocks or water baths for MessageAmp II reaction incubations.&lt;br> The MessageAmp II procedure is very sensitive to temperature; therefore use incubators that have been professionally calibrated according the manufacturers recommended schedule. Variable or inaccurate incubation temperatures can limit aRNA synthesis. Preheat incubators if necessary so that the correct temperature has stabilized before reactions are placed in the incubator. It is also very important that condensation does&lt;br> not form in the reaction tubes during any of the incubations. Condensation changes the composition of reaction mixtures, and we have seen that it can greatly reduce yield.&lt;br> &lt;br> Maintaining consistency&lt;br> &lt;br> Procedural consistency is very important for planning amplification experiments. Consider implementing a detailed procedural plan that will be used by everyone in the lab to maintain consistency. This type of plan will minimize variation due to subtle procedural differences that can influence RNA amplification, and which may&lt;br> complicate gene expression studies. The plan should include basic information such as the method of RNA isolation, the amount of RNA to use in the procedure, and how long to incubate the IVT reaction. It should also address specifics that are not often included in protocols such as which tubes, tube racks, and incubators to use for each step in the process. Finally, develop a consistent work flow, for example standardize stopping points in the method. The idea is to standardize all of the variables discussed in this section of the Instruction Manual and carefully follow all the protocol steps in order to maximize amplification consistency among samples.&lt;br> &lt;br> Prepare the Wash Buffer&lt;br> &lt;br> Add 24 ml ACS grade 100% ethanol (ACS grade or better) to the bottle labeled aRNA Wash Buffer.

Place the tubes in a 16°C thermal cycler. It is important to cool the thermal cycler block to 16°C before adding the reaction tubes because subjecting the reactions to temperatures >16°C will compromise aRNA yield.&lt;br> 2. Incubate 2 hr at 16°C&lt;br>  Incubate 2 hr in a 16°C thermal cycler. If the lid temperature cannot be adjusted to match the 16°C block temperature, cover the reactions with the heated lid turned off, or if the lid cannot be turned offdo not cover the tubes with it. (Do not use a water bath or a heat block in a 4°C refrigerator for this incubation because the temperature will fluctuate too much.)&lt;br> &lt;br> 3. Place reactions on ice briefly or freeze immediately&lt;br> &lt;br> After the 2 hr incubation at 16°C, place the reactions on ice and proceed to. cDNA Purification (below), or immediately freeze reactions at 20°C. Do not leave the reactions on ice for long periods of time.&lt;br> This is a potential overnight stopping point, but it is better to complete the cDNA purification (next section) before stopping.&lt;br> &lt;br> cDNA Purification&lt;br> cDNA Filter Cartridges should not be subjected to RCFs over 16,000 x g because it could cause mechanical damage and/or may deposit glass filter fiber in the eluate.  All centrifugations in this purification procedure should be done at 10,000 x g (typically ~10,000 rpm) at room temp.&lt;br> &lt;br> 1. Preheat Nuclease-free Water to 5055°C&lt;br> Before beginning the cDNA purification, preheat the 10 ml bottle of Nuclease-free Water to 5055°C for at least 10 min.&lt;br> Preheat the Nuclease-free Water to a maximum of 55°C; temperatures above 58°C can partially denature the cDNA, compromising final yield of aRNA.&lt;br> &lt;br> 2.

Pass the mixture through a cDNA Filter Cartridge&lt;br> Before using them, check each cDNA Filter Cartridge to make sure that the filters are flush against the bottom of the mini-column; push them into place with the wide end of a pipet tip if necessary. Also check that the cDNA Filter Cartridge is firmly seated in its wash tube (supplied).&lt;br> a.

Mix well and mark the label to indicate that the ethanol was added.&lt;br> &lt;br> a. Apply 500 µl cDNA Wash Buffer to each cDNA Filter Cartridge.&lt;br> b.

Transfer cDNA Filter Cartridge to a cDNA Elution Tube.&lt;br> &lt;br> 5. Elute cDNA with 2 X 9.0 µl 5055°C Nuclease-free Water&lt;br> It is important to use Nuclease-free Water that is at 5055°C for the cDNA elution. Colder water will be less efficient at eluting the cDNA, and hotter water (&amp;#8805;&amp;#2265;58°C) may result in reduced aRNA yield.&lt;br> &lt;br> a. Apply 9.0 µl of Nuclease-free Water (preheated to 5055°C) to the center of the filter in the cDNA Filter Cartridge.&lt;br> b. Leave at room temperature for 2 min and then centrifuge for ~1.5 min at 10,000 x g, or until all the Nuclease-free Water is through the filter.&lt;br> c. Elute with a second 9.0 µl of preheated Nuclease-free Water. The double-stranded cDNA will now be in the eluate (~14 µl).&lt;br> d. Proceed directly to section F.

Samples that will undergo two rounds of amplification cannot be labeled with biotin at this step because it would interfere with the second round of amplification.&lt;br> For the highest aRNA yield, conduct the IVT in a 40 µl final reaction volume. We provide instructions for a 20 µl biotin-labeled reaction for users who want to reduce the reaction cost by using only half the biotin-labeled nucleotides ( here we do not provide the protocol for biotin labeled nucleotides).&lt;br> &lt;br> Add IVT Master Mix to each sample&lt;br> At room temp, prepare an IVT Master Mix by adding the following reagents to a nuclease-free microfuge tube in the order listed below.

      <name>Transcription profiling of pig endothelium from multiple sites of coronary and non-coronary arteries</name>
      <description>This study investigates the role of endothelial cell (EC) gene expression in the focal origin of atherosclerosis. The EC transcriptome was profiled in multiple arterial regions of normal swine. Specifically, small amounts of EC RNA were isolated from 7 athero-susceptible and 6 athero-protected regions. The number of replicates for each site varied between 4 and 8. A total of 98 samples from 76 animals were used. For each sample, linearly amplified RNA (labeled with Cy5) was co-hybridized with pooled arterial reference RNA (labeled with Cy3) onto a custom-printed porcine oligo microarray (70-mers).</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Hybridization - Labeled RNA was dried to 27 ul using a vacuum drier at low heat setting. In order to facilitate hybridization efficiency, labeled RNA was fragmented using a fragmentation reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX). 3 ul of 10X fragmentation reagent were added and the mixture was incubated at 70 C for 15 minutes. The fragmentation reaction was inhibited by the addition of 3 ul stop reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX). Each Cy5-conjugated RNA was combined with an equal volume of Cy3-conjugated RNA. Nuclease-free water was added to each sample to a total volume of 70 ul followed by the addition of 1 ul of 10 mg/ml herring sperm DNA. 71 ul of 2X hybridization buffer (Proteomics Research Solutions Cat. No. PRS-16003050, Ann Arbor, MI) were added to the samples and they were incubated at 95 C for 5 minutes and centrifuged at 10,000g for 1 minute. Samples were loaded onto custom-printed oligo microarrays. Microarrays were hybridized in a Genomics Solution HybStation (Ann Arbor, MI) using a step-down protocol (42 C, 35 C, 30 C each for 5 hours). Microarrays were later washed with medium stringency buffer (PRS-16004001, Proteomics Research Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI) at 30 C for 2 minutes, followed by a high stringency buffer (PRS-16004501, Proteomics Research Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI) wash at 25 C for 2 minutes. Finally, microarrays were washed with post wash buffer (PRS-16003501, Proteomics Research Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI) at 25 C for 2 minutes. They were later dipped into deionized water for 30 seconds and were dried by centrifugation at 500 g for 1 minute. When there were more than 12 assays, hybridizations were done in batches of 12 in random order over several days.
 Labeling - Amplified RNA was thawed and dried using a vacuum dryer at low heat setting. RNA was reconstituted in 9 ul coupling buffer (Amino Allyl MessageAmp aRNA kit, Ambion, Austin, TX). Mono-functional NHS ester Cy3 or Cy5 dye, reconstituted in 11 ul DMSO, was added (Amersham Cy Dye Post-labelling Reactive Pack, GE Healthcare, UK). In all experiments, reference aRNA and sample aRNA were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent dyes, respectively, and were then incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at room temperature. 4.5 ul 4 M Hydroxylamine (Ambion, Austin, TX) was added for 15 minutes to quench the dye coupling reaction. Dye-coupled RNA was purified into nuclease-free water using the aRNA filter cartridges (Ambion MessageAmp kit) in order to remove excess dye. Final volume of dye-conjugated RNA was 150 ul.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Cells were lysed in a buffer containing guanidine isothiocyanate and beta-Mercaptoethanol. The lysate was homogenized and precipitated with 70% ethanol, transferred to a silica membrane column, and DNA and proteins were removed by a series of washes and centrifugations. Highly purified total RNA was then eluted from the column using RNase-free water. For the Nanoprep kit, 2 x 10 uL elutions were used. For the Microprep kit, 2 x 30 uL elutions were used.</field>

 Hybridization -  Hybridization using Jack Bell 21K Human Microarray slides&lt;br> &lt;br> a. Pre-hybridization and pretreatment of slides:&lt;br> &lt;br> i. Prepare 500 ml pre-Hybridization Solution in MilliQ water as follows:&lt;br> &lt;br> 125 ml  20 x SSC (final conc 5X SSC)      &lt;br> 5ml 10% SDS (final conc 0.1% SDS)&lt;br> &lt;br> 1g  BSA (solid) (final conc 0.2% BSA)&lt;br> &lt;br> ii. Warm the pre-hyb solution to 37&amp;#61616;C to dissolve.&lt;br> iii. NOTE:  Use a cleaned pair of tweezers EVERY TIME you touch the slides.  Pre-hybridization buffer contains BSA and will leave a large streak down the slide, and ruin the subsequent scans.&lt;br> iv. Place slides into a clean wash vessel, pour approximately 450 ml of  pre-hyb buffer in and incubate at 48 &amp;#61616;C for 45 mins.  Make sure that the solution covers the slides.&lt;br> v. Wash the slides twice by dipping up and down around 10 times each in MilliQ water in clean wash vessels. &lt;br> vi. Wash the slides once by dipping up and down around 10 times in  RT isopropanol.&lt;br> vii. Spin dry the slides at 1,000 rpm for 5 mins at RT. &lt;br> viii. NOTE:  Make sure the slides are used within one hour of spinning dry.  Atmospheric humidity will cause problems.&lt;br> &lt;br> b.  1 mm LifterSlip cleaning (Eerie Scientific: 25X60I-2-4789)&lt;br> &lt;br> i. Dip lifter slip in clean dH2O&lt;br> ii.

After analyzing your labeled samples by absorbance, take 20 pmol of Cy3-labelled sample and 20 pmol of Cy5-labelled sample and combine the samples to be hybridized on one slide together.  &lt;br> ii. Add 1 µl GFP labeled probe.&lt;br> iii. Speed vac the samples, DO NOT OVERDRY, try to leave around 1-2 &amp;#61549;l in the tube (dried nucleic acids dissolve poorly in hybridization buffer). In case the sample goes completely dry add 1  2 &amp;#61549;l NF- water to the pellet and tap and re-suspend.  &lt;br> iv. Make up hybridization solution master mix for all the slides. &lt;br> v.

Add 80 &amp;#61549;l of the hybridization buffer to each tube with the speed vac-concentrated samples. &lt;br> vii. Mix the sample with the hybridization buffer and denature the sample at 90&amp;#61616;C for 1 min.&lt;br> viii. Keep the sample on ice for at least 1 min.&lt;br> ix. Remove it from ice, spin down quickly using table top microcentrifuge and keep samples covered from light at RT or warmer until ready to put on slide.&lt;br> x. Place the pretreated cover slips on slides, one at a time&lt;br> xi. Pipet all of the sample onto the spotted side of the pretreated slide under the short side of the lifter slip. Wait until the sample reaches the far side of the lifterslip and if required inject the last 5 -10 &amp;#61549;l of the sample under the far side of the lifterslip. [NOTE: Keep in mind the spotted side of the slide with respect to the barcode]&lt;br> xii. Place the slide in a corning cassette with 10 &amp;#61549;l NF-H2O in each well of the cassette and close.&lt;br> xiii. Seal Hybridization Chamber.

 Labeling - In this protocol we use the Ambion kit # 1751, MessageAmp II which amplifies RNA producing aRNA ( cRNA).  This aRNA is hybridized to the 21 K slides purchased from Jack Bell Research Centre.&lt;br> &lt;br> Important Parameters for Successful Amplification&lt;br> &lt;br> Input RNA quantity and IVT reaction incubation Time&lt;br> &lt;br> Consider both the amount of sample RNA you have, and the amount of aRNA needed for your experiments when planning MessageAmp II experiments. These factors will influence how much input RNA is used, whether one or two rounds of amplification should be done, and how long to incubate the IVT reaction.&lt;br> &lt;br> Accurate quantification&lt;br> &lt;br> For experiments where the aRNA yield from different samples will be compared, it is&lt;br> Essential to accurately quantify the input RNA used in the MessageAmp II procedure. &lt;br> &lt;br> Recommended minimum and maximum amounts of input RNA&lt;br> &lt;br> Table 1 shows the mass of total RNA that can be used in the MessageAmp II aRNA procedure. Alternatively 10100 ng of poly(A) selected RNA can be used in the procedure. RNA must be in a maximum volume of 11 µl.&lt;br> &lt;br> Table 1: Amount of Total RNA to use in MessageAmp II.&lt;br> &lt;br> Amplification Recommended Minimum  Maximum&lt;br> Single Round 1000 ng 100 ng 5000 ng&lt;br> Two Rounds 100 ng 0.1 ng 100 ng&lt;br> &lt;br> RNA amount and IVT reaction incubation time&lt;br> &lt;br> The MessageAmp II procedure can accommodate a wide range of input RNA amounts, but for reproducible and comparable results, use a fixed amount of RNA for all experiments. Tailor both the amount of input RNA used and the amplification procedure to produce the amount of aRNA needed for your microarray hybridizations. For instance, Affymetrix GeneChips require 1015 µg of aRNA for each hybridization, but other commercial and core facility arrays may require slightly more or less aRNA.&lt;br> Figure 3 shows aRNA yields from different amounts of Control RNA amplified with increasing IVT incubation times. When amplifying small RNA samples however, (e.g. ~250 ng or less) incubating the IVT reaction for 14 hr will maximize the amount of aRNA produced.&lt;br> Typically 100 ng of total RNA input is the lower limit for synthesizing ~10 µg of aRNA using a 4 hr IVT reaction. If your total RNA samples will be ~100 ng or less, we advise conducting a preliminary amplification from a representative sample to determine empirically how much aRNA you can expect from your experimental samples. If the preliminary experiment does not produce enough aRNA for two array hybridizations, repeat the experiment using an IVT incubation as long as 14 hr, and/or consider using two rounds of amplification.&lt;br> &lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br> RNA Purity&lt;br> &lt;br> The single most important factor affecting how efficiently an RNA sample will be amplified using the MessageAmp II aRNA Kit is the quality of the RNA. RNA samples should be free of contaminating proteins, DNA, and other cellular material as well as phenol, ethanol, and salts associated with RNA isolation procedures.&lt;br> Impurities can lower the efficiency of reverse transcription and subsequently reduce the level of amplification. An effective measure of RNA purity is the ratio of absorbance readings at 260 and 280 nm. The ratio of A260 to A280 values should fall in the range of 1.72.1. RNA must be suspended in high quality water or TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA).&lt;br> &lt;br> RNA integrity&lt;br> The integrity of the RNA sample, or the proportion that is full-length, is another important component of RNA quality. Reverse transcribing partially degraded mRNAs will typically generate relatively short cDNAs that lack the sequence encoded upstream of the break in the RNA molecule.&lt;br> There are currently no quantitative methods for measuring what percentage of mRNAs in a sample are full-length, however several procedures do exist for establishing the relative integrity of a sample. A method that requires only nanogram quantities of RNA is microfluidic sample analysis using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and an RNA LabChip®&lt;br> Kit. The bioanalyzer fractionates RNA molecules according to size, so that the amounts&lt;br> of 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) can be determined. Primarily full-length RNA will exhibit a ratio of 28S to 18S rRNA bands that approaches 2:1.&lt;br> Denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and nucleic acid staining can also be used to separate and visualize the major rRNA species. When the RNA resolves into discrete rRNA bands (i.e. no significant smearing below each band), with the 28S rRNA band appearing approximately twice as intense as the 18S rRNA band, then the mRNA in the sample is likely to be mostly full-length. The primary drawback to gel electrophoresis is that  microgram amounts of RNA must be sacrificed.&lt;br> &lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br> Reaction Incubation times should be precise and consistent&lt;br> &lt;br> The incubation times in the protocol were optimized in conjunction with the kit reagents to ensure the maximum yield of nucleic acid product in each stepadhere to them closely.&lt;br> A range of 414 hr is given for the IVT reaction incubation time (step II.F.3 on page 13). Refer to the graph in Figure 3 on page 7 to help determine what incubation time to use. Keep this IVT incubation time uniform if aRNA yield from different samples will be compared, or if you want to have equal amplification of different samples. Although differences in IVT incubation time among samples has had very little, if any, effect on array results in our hands, we still recommend using a uniform IVT incubation time for the most reproducible amplification and array analysis.&lt;br> &lt;br> Master Mixes&lt;br> &lt;br> We strongly recommend preparing master mixes for the MessageAmp II procedure. This approach reduces the effects of pipetting error, and improves reproducibility. Using Master Mixes is especially important when aRNA yield from different samples will be compared.  Ambion provides a web-based Master Mix calculator at the following address: &lt;br> &lt;br> www.ambion.com/techlib/append/msgamp2_mm_calc.php&lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br> Thorough mixing is very important for reproducibility&lt;br> &lt;br> Below are specific instructions for mixing kit reagents, Master Mixes, and individual reactions. For maximum reproducibility and aRNA yield, follow these instructions closely. &lt;br>  Mix each kit component after thawing.&lt;br> &lt;br> Mix enzyme solutions by gently flicking the tube a few times before adding them to reactions. Thaw frozen reagents completely at room temperature (i.e. primers, nucleotides and 10 X buffers), then mix thoroughly by vortexing, and keep on ice before use.&lt;br>  Mix Master Mixes by gentle vortexing.&lt;br> &lt;br> After assembling Master Mixes, gently vortex to make a homogenous mixture without inactivating the enzyme(s).&lt;br> &lt;br>  Mix individual reactions by pipetting up and down 23 times, then flicking the tube 34 times, and finally spinning briefly.&lt;br&gt; After adding Master Mixes or other reagents to individual reactions, pipet up and down 23 times to rinse reagents from the pipet tip. Then flick the tube with your finger 34 times to mix thoroughly, and finish by centrifuging briefly to collect the reaction at the bottom of the tube. &lt;br> &lt;br> Incubator recommendations&lt;br> &lt;br>  We recommend a calibrated hybridization oven or incubator (at constant temperature) for most of the MessageAmp II incubations.&lt;br> To avoid any potential influence on the reaction temperature from the tube holder, let tube holders equilibrate in the incubator for sufficient time, or use a tube holder that doesnt touch the sides and bottoms of the tubesfor example a floating tube support.&lt;br> &lt;br>  For the 16°C second strand synthesis reaction incubation (step II.D.2&lt;br> on page 11), we recommend using a thermal cycler&lt;br> . Ideally these reactions should be incubated in a calibrated thermal cycler with a lid temperature that matches the block temperature. Most machines do not have this feature, so if the lid temperature is static (~100°C), use it with the heat turned off, or do not use the heated lid at all. Otherwise heat from the lid will raise the temperature of the solution in the tube, compromising the reaction.&lt;br>  We do not recommend using heat blocks or water baths for MessageAmp II reaction incubations.&lt;br> The MessageAmp II procedure is very sensitive to temperature; therefore use incubators that have been professionally calibrated according the manufacturers recommended schedule. Variable or inaccurate incubation temperatures can limit aRNA synthesis. Preheat incubators if necessary so that the correct temperature has stabilized before reactions are placed in the incubator. It is also very important that condensation does&lt;br> not form in the reaction tubes during any of the incubations. Condensation changes the composition of reaction mixtures, and we have seen that it can greatly reduce yield.&lt;br> &lt;br> Maintaining consistency&lt;br> &lt;br> Procedural consistency is very important for planning amplification experiments. Consider implementing a detailed procedural plan that will be used by everyone in the lab to maintain consistency. This type of plan will minimize variation due to subtle procedural differences that can influence RNA amplification, and which may&lt;br> complicate gene expression studies. The plan should include basic information such as the method of RNA isolation, the amount of RNA to use in the procedure, and how long to incubate the IVT reaction. It should also address specifics that are not often included in protocols such as which tubes, tube racks, and incubators to use for each step in the process. Finally, develop a consistent work flow, for example standardize stopping points in the method. The idea is to standardize all of the variables discussed in this section of the Instruction Manual and carefully follow all the protocol steps in order to maximize amplification consistency among samples.&lt;br> &lt;br> Prepare the Wash Buffer&lt;br> &lt;br> Add 24 ml ACS grade 100% ethanol (ACS grade or better) to the bottle labeled aRNA Wash Buffer.

Place the tubes in a 16°C thermal cycler. It is important to cool the thermal cycler block to 16°C before adding the reaction tubes because subjecting the reactions to temperatures >16°C will compromise aRNA yield.&lt;br> 2. Incubate 2 hr at 16°C&lt;br>  Incubate 2 hr in a 16°C thermal cycler. If the lid temperature cannot be adjusted to match the 16°C block temperature, cover the reactions with the heated lid turned off, or if the lid cannot be turned offdo not cover the tubes with it. (Do not use a water bath or a heat block in a 4°C refrigerator for this incubation because the temperature will fluctuate too much.)&lt;br> &lt;br> 3. Place reactions on ice briefly or freeze immediately&lt;br> &lt;br> After the 2 hr incubation at 16°C, place the reactions on ice and proceed to. cDNA Purification (below), or immediately freeze reactions at 20°C. Do not leave the reactions on ice for long periods of time.&lt;br> This is a potential overnight stopping point, but it is better to complete the cDNA purification (next section) before stopping.&lt;br> &lt;br> cDNA Purification&lt;br> cDNA Filter Cartridges should not be subjected to RCFs over 16,000 x g because it could cause mechanical damage and/or may deposit glass filter fiber in the eluate.  All centrifugations in this purification procedure should be done at 10,000 x g (typically ~10,000 rpm) at room temp.&lt;br> &lt;br> 1. Preheat Nuclease-free Water to 5055°C&lt;br> Before beginning the cDNA purification, preheat the 10 ml bottle of Nuclease-free Water to 5055°C for at least 10 min.&lt;br> Preheat the Nuclease-free Water to a maximum of 55°C; temperatures above 58°C can partially denature the cDNA, compromising final yield of aRNA.&lt;br> &lt;br> 2. Add 250 µl cDNA Binding Buffer to each sample&lt;br> Add 250 µl of cDNA Binding Buffer to each sample from step D.2 on page 11, and mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down 23 times, then flicking the tube 34 times. Follow up with a quick spin to collect the reaction in the bottom of the tube. Proceed quickly to the next step.&lt;br> &lt;br> 3. Pass the mixture through a cDNA Filter Cartridge&lt;br> Before using them, check each cDNA Filter Cartridge to make sure that the filters are flush against the bottom of the mini-column; push them into place with the wide end of a pipet tip if necessary. Also check that the cDNA Filter Cartridge is firmly seated in its wash tube (supplied).&lt;br> a. Pipet the cDNA sample\cDNA Binding Buffer (from step 2) onto the center of the cDNA Filter Cartridge.&lt;br> b. Centrifuge for ~1 min at 10,000 x g, or until the mixture is through the filter.&lt;br> c.

Discard the flow-through and spin the cDNA Filter Cartridge for an additional minute to remove trace amounts of ethanol.&lt;br> d. Transfer cDNA Filter Cartridge to a cDNA Elution Tube.&lt;br> &lt;br> 5. Elute cDNA with 2 X 9.0 µl 5055°C Nuclease-free Water&lt;br> It is important to use Nuclease-free Water that is at 5055°C for the cDNA elution. Colder water will be less efficient at eluting the cDNA, and hotter water (&amp;#8805;&amp;#2265;58°C) may result in reduced aRNA yield.&lt;br> &lt;br> a. Apply 9.0 µl of Nuclease-free Water (preheated to 5055°C) to the center of the filter in the cDNA Filter Cartridge.&lt;br> b. Leave at room temperature for 2 min and then centrifuge for ~1.5 min at 10,000 x g, or until all the Nuclease-free Water is through the filter.&lt;br> c. Elute with a second 9.0 µl of preheated Nuclease-free Water. The double-stranded cDNA will now be in the eluate (~14 µl).&lt;br> d. Proceed directly to section F. In Vitro Transcription to Synthesize aRNA, or place the cDNA at 20°C.&lt;br> The purified cDNA can be stored overnight at 20°C at this point if desired.&lt;br> &lt;br> In Vitro Transcription to Synthesize aRNA Incubator needed:&lt;br> &lt;br>  37°C (hybridization oven or incubator recommended)&lt;br> &lt;br> The IVT reaction can be set up to synthesize unmodified aRNA, or biotin-labeled nucleotides (or other modified nucleotides) can be incorporated into the aRNA during the IVT. Samples that will undergo two rounds of amplification cannot be labeled with biotin at this step because it would interfere with the second round of amplification.&lt;br> For the highest aRNA yield, conduct the IVT in a 40 µl final reaction volume. We provide instructions for a 20 µl biotin-labeled reaction for users who want to reduce the reaction cost by using only half the biotin-labeled nucleotides ( here we do not provide the protocol for biotin labeled nucleotides).&lt;br> &lt;br> Add IVT Master Mix to each sample&lt;br> At room temp, prepare an IVT Master Mix by adding the following reagents to a nuclease-free microfuge tube in the order listed below.

It is important to maintain a constant 37°C incubation temperature. We recommend incubating in an incubator such as a hybridization oven because it is extremely important that condensation does not form inside the tubes; this would change the reagent concentrations and reduce yield.&lt;br> &lt;br> Note: we incubate for 4 hours at 37°&lt;br> &lt;br> Add Nuclease-free Water to bring each sample to 100 µl&lt;br> Stop the reaction by adding Nuclease-free Water to each aRNA sample to bring the final volume to 100 µl.

Transfer Filter Cartridge(s) to a fresh aRNA Collection Tube.&lt;br> &lt;br> 7. Elute aRNA with 100 µ preheated Nuclease-free Water&lt;br> a. To the center of the filter, add 100 µl Nuclease-free Water that is preheated to 5060°C.&lt;br> b. Leave at room temperature for 2 min and then centrifuge for ~1.5 min at 10,000 X g, or until the solution is through the filter.&lt;br> c. The aRNA will now be in the aRNA Collection Tube in ~100 µl of Nuclease-free Water.&lt;br> The purified aRNA can be stored at 20°C overnight, or at 80°C for longer times if desired.&lt;br> &lt;br> Amino Allyl aRNA:Dye Coupling and Clean-up&lt;br> This kit was developed with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes from Amersham Pharmacia&lt;br> Biotech, but mono-reactive NHS esters of any label moiety&lt;br> should be capable of coupling to the amino allyl modified aRNA generated&lt;br> with this kit.

To couple an aRNA to more than one dye, transfer the aRNA per dye to a single tube and vacuum dry to 7 µl per&lt;br> dye. &lt;br> If the heater on the vacuum centrifuge is adjustable, use the medium or low temperature setting.&lt;br> Check the progress of drying every 510 min, and remove the sample from the concentrator when it reaches the desired volume; do not overdry.&lt;br> &lt;br> NHS Ester Dye Preparation&lt;br> Prepare dye immediately before starting the dye coupling procedures. The preparation and storage of solubilized dye is important for the efficient labeling of amino allyl modified aRNA. It is imperative that the dye compounds remain&lt;br> dry both before and after dissolving in DMSO because any water that is introduced will cause hydrolysis of the NHS esters, lowering the efficiency of coupling.&lt;br> &lt;br> IMPORTANT&lt;br> Store any unused solubilized dye in the dark at 80°C.

If so re-dissolve by warming at room temperature and keep at room temperature until used.&lt;br> &lt;br> Preparation before procedure &lt;br> 1. Lysis buffer: Buffer RLT + beta-ME beta-mercaptoethanol). Add 10 ul beta-ME per 1ml buffer RLT before use. &lt;br> 2. Calculate the total volume of RLT buffer required and add appropriate amount of beta-ME.&lt;br> 3. Add x 4 volumes of ethanol to Buffer RPE (as indicated on the bottle of the buffer), to obtain a working solution.&lt;br> 4. For the on-column DNase digestion with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen cat # 79254), prepare a DNase I stock solution by dissolving solid DNase I (1500 Kunitz units) in 550 ul RNase free-H2O provided in the kit. Mix gently by inverting the tube. DO NOT VORTEX. For long term storage, make single use (40 ul / tube; for 4 reactions) aliquots and store them at -20 C for up to 9 months. DO NOT FREEZE THAW.

After the second wash, discarding the flow through each time, gently close the tube and centrifuge for 2 min at greater than 8000 x g (greater than 10,000 rpm) to dry the RNeasy silica gel membrane.&lt;br> 17. Place the column in a new 1.5 ml collection tube for elution.&lt;br> 18. Pipette 30 ul RNase-free water directly onto the silica-gel membrane. Close the tube gently and centrifuge for 1 min at greater than 8000 x g (greater than 10,000 rpm). Repeat these elution steps twice. The total sample volume eluted from the columns will be around 60 ul.&lt;br> 19. Pool the two identical samples together, the total volume per sample will be 120 ul.&lt;br> 20. Speed vac and concentrate the sample to approximately less than one-third the volume. &lt;br> 21. NOTE: Required concentration of total RNA for microarrays cannot be less than 1 ug/ul.&lt;br> 22. Add 1 ul RNase Inhibitor to your sample (NOTE this is not indicated in the Qiagen kit handbook).&lt;br> 23. Aliquot 4 ul of the sample into a new tube for Quality Control (QC) of RNA.&lt;br> 24. Store samples at - 80 C for further use.&lt;br> &lt;br> Quality Control For RNA&lt;br> 25. Dilute the QC RNA sample 1/50; 2 ul of RNA + 98 ul of NF-water.&lt;br> 26. Place 100 ul of the diluted RNA samples in a disposable UVette and read absorbance using the program for RNA concentration in the spectrophotomer in room 235. &lt;br> 27. Record the dilution factor in the spectrophotomer as per the program to get the right concentration in ng/ul.&lt;br> 28. Read measure OD 260 and OD 260/280 ratio.&lt;br> 29. Run approximately 1 ug of sample (approximately 3 ul) per well on a 1% Agarose gel. Run gel at 100 V for about 40 mins, until the dye front has run approximately half the length of the gel.&lt;br> 30. The gel image must be stored and recorded before submitting the sample for microarray analysis.&lt;br> 31. Bioanalysis of the RNA using Agilent will be done before determining the input RNA concentration for microarrays.&lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br></field>

      <name>Transcription profiling of peripheral blood monocytes from healthy humans and from those with Chronic Granulamatous Disease in response to stimulation with peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide</name>
      <description>Persons with Chronic Granulomatous Disease, are susceptible to a narrow range of infections resulting from the failure of cells to generate toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) required for phagocytice oxidative killing of microorganisms.  For unknown reasons, many inflammatory conditions (inflammatory bowel disease, periodontal inflammation, granulomatous obstruction of the urinary and gastrointestinal tract and &amp;#8220;sterile&amp;#8221; inflammation of the lungs and other organs) are also associated with the disease. The goal of this study is to investigate the role of ROS in the regulation of inflammatory and immunity genes induced by Toll-like Receptors (TLRs).  Transcriptional responses to peptidoglycan or lipopolysaccharide (TLR2/4 agonists) were evaluated at 4 and 24 hrs in peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) from three males with CGD compared to PBM from 5 healthy individuals.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Venous blood (100 ml) from 5 healthy volunteers was collected in Vacutainer collection tubes containing sodium heparin as an anticoagulant (Becton Dickinson, Mississauga, ON).  Blood was diluted 1:1 with complete RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Invitrogen Life technologies, Burlington, ON), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (all from Invitrogen Life Technologies), then separated by centrifugation over a Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) density gradient.  White blood cells were isolated from the buffy coat, washed twice in RPMI 1640 complete medium, and the number of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was determined by trypan blue exclusion.  PBMC (2 x 10^7) were seeded into 6-well tissue culture dishes (Falcon; Becton Dickinson) at 5 x 10^6 cells/ml and incubated at 37 degree Celsius in 5% CO2 for 1 hr prior to activation. 
 Sample Processing - PBMC were incubated for 24hr at 37 degree Celsius in 5% CO2 in the presence of 10ug/ml peptidoglycan (PGN).  Reagent was tested for endotoxin and reconstituted in endotoxin-free water. Stimulation was performed on PBMC from 5 healthy adults. PBMC were transferred to 15 ml tubes (Falcon; Becton Dickinson), using 1ml of Versene to detach adherent cells.  PBMC were washed twice into PBS containing 5 mM EDTA and 2% FCS to a final concentration of  ~1 x 10^7cells/ml.  Cells were rotated end over end at 4 degree Celsius for 1 hr with 25 ul of anti-CD14 conjugated magnetic beads (M450; Dynal; Invitrogen) per ml of cells.  Beads were immobilized with a magnet (Dynal; Invitrogen) and washed 3 x 1 ml with PBS.  RNA was isolated from CD14+ PBMC with RNeasy Mini kit, treated with RNase-Free DNase (Qiagen Inc., Canada) and eluted in RNase-free water (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX, USA) as per manufacturer's instructions. An equal quantity of RNA from each of the healthy individuals was pooled into one control sample for the microarray.
 Hybridization - Hybridization using Jack Bell 21K Human Microarray slides &lt;br> &lt;br> Pre-hybridization and pretreatment of slides: &lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br> i. Prepare 500 ml pre-Hybridization Solution in MilliQ water as follows: 125 ml 20 x SSC (final conc 5X SSC) 5ml 10% SDS (final conc 0.1% SDS) 1g BSA (solid) (final conc 0.2% BSA) &lt;br> &lt;br> ii. Warm the pre-hyb solution to 37 degree Celsius to dissolve. &lt;br> &lt;br> iii. NOTE: Use a cleaned pair of tweezers every time you touch the slides. Pre-hybridization buffer contains BSA and will leave a large streak down the slide, and ruin the subsequent scans. &lt;br> &lt;br> iv. Place slides into a clean wash vessel, pour approximately 450 ml of pre-hyb buffer in and incubate at 48 degree Celsius  for 45 mins. Make sure that the solution covers the slides. &lt;br> &lt;br> v. Wash the slides twice by dipping up and down around 10 times each in MilliQ water in clean wash vessels. &lt;br> &lt;br> vi. Wash the slides once by dipping up and down around 10 times in room temperature isopropanol. &lt;br> &lt;br> vii. Spin dry the slides at 1,000 rpm for 5 mins at room temperature. &lt;br> &lt;br> viii. NOTE: Make sure the slides are used within one hour of spinning dry. Atmospheric humidity will cause problems. b. 1 mm &lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br> LifterSlip cleaning (Eerie Scientific: 25X60I-2-4789) &lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br> i.

 Labeling - In this protocol we use the Ambion kit # 1751, MessageAmp II which amplifies RNA producing aRNA ( cRNA).  This aRNA is hybridized to the 21 K slides purchased from Jack Bell Research Centre.&lt;br> &lt;br&gt; Important Parameters for Successful Amplification&lt;br> &lt;br> Input RNA quantity and IVT reaction incubation Time&lt;br> &lt;br> Consider both the amount of sample RNA you have, and the amount of aRNA needed for your experiments when planning MessageAmp II experiments. These factors will influence how much input RNA is used, whether one or two rounds of amplification should be done, and how long to incubate the IVT reaction.&lt;br> &lt;br> Accurate quantification&lt;br> &lt;br> For experiments where the aRNA yield from different samples will be compared, it is&lt;br> Essential to accurately quantify the input RNA used in the MessageAmp II procedure. &lt;br> &lt;br> Recommended minimum and maximum amounts of input RNA&lt;br> &lt;br> Table 1 shows the mass of total RNA that can be used in the MessageAmp II aRNA procedure. Alternatively 10100 ng of poly(A) selected RNA can be used in the procedure. RNA must be in a maximum volume of 11 µl.&lt;br> &lt;br> Table 1: Amount of Total RNA to use in MessageAmp II.&lt;br> &lt;br> Amplification Recommended Minimum  Maximum&lt;br> Single Round 1000 ng 100 ng 5000 ng&lt;br> Two Rounds 100 ng 0.1 ng 100 ng&lt;br> &lt;br> RNA amount and IVT reaction incubation time&lt;br> &lt;br> The MessageAmp II procedure can accommodate a wide range of input RNA amounts, but for reproducible and comparable results, use a fixed amount of RNA for all experiments. Tailor both the amount of input RNA used and the amplification procedure to produce the amount of aRNA needed for your microarray hybridizations. For instance, Affymetrix GeneChips require 1015 µg of aRNA for each hybridization, but other commercial and core facility arrays may require slightly more or less aRNA.&lt;br> Figure 3 shows aRNA yields from different amounts of Control RNA amplified with increasing IVT incubation times. When amplifying small RNA samples however, (e.g. ~250 ng or less) incubating the IVT reaction for 14 hr will maximize the amount of aRNA produced.&lt;br> Typically 100 ng of total RNA input is the lower limit for synthesizing ~10 µg of aRNA using a 4 hr IVT reaction. If your total RNA samples will be ~100 ng or less, we advise conducting a preliminary amplification from a representative sample to determine empirically how much aRNA you can expect from your experimental samples. If the preliminary experiment does not produce enough aRNA for two array hybridizations, repeat the experiment using an IVT incubation as long as 14 hr, and/or consider using two rounds of amplification.&lt;br> &lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br> RNA Purity&lt;br> &lt;br> The single most important factor affecting how efficiently an RNA sample will be amplified using the MessageAmp II aRNA Kit is the quality of the RNA. RNA samples should be free of contaminating proteins, DNA, and other cellular material as well as phenol, ethanol, and salts associated with RNA isolation procedures.&lt;br> Impurities can lower the efficiency of reverse transcription and subsequently reduce the level of amplification. An effective measure of RNA purity is the ratio of absorbance readings at 260 and 280 nm. The ratio of A260 to A280 values should fall in the range of 1.72.1. RNA must be suspended in high quality water or TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA).&lt;br> &lt;br> RNA integrity&lt;br> The integrity of the RNA sample, or the proportion that is full-length, is another important component of RNA quality. Reverse transcribing partially degraded mRNAs will typically generate relatively short cDNAs that lack the sequence encoded upstream of the break in the RNA molecule.&lt;br> There are currently no quantitative methods for measuring what percentage of mRNAs in a sample are full-length, however several procedures do exist for establishing the relative integrity of a sample. A method that requires only nanogram quantities of RNA is microfluidic sample analysis using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and an RNA LabChip®&lt;br> Kit. The bioanalyzer fractionates RNA molecules according to size, so that the amounts&lt;br> of 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) can be determined. Primarily full-length RNA will exhibit a ratio of 28S to 18S rRNA bands that approaches 2:1.&lt;br> Denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and nucleic acid staining can also be used to separate and visualize the major rRNA species. When the RNA resolves into discrete rRNA bands (i.e. no significant smearing below each band), with the 28S rRNA band appearing approximately twice as intense as the 18S rRNA band, then the mRNA in the sample is likely to be mostly full-length. The primary drawback to gel electrophoresis is that  microgram amounts of RNA must be sacrificed.&lt;br> &lt;br>  &lt;br> &lt;br> Reaction Incubation times should be precise and consistent&lt;br> &lt;br> The incubation times in the protocol were optimized in conjunction with the kit reagents to ensure the maximum yield of nucleic acid product in each stepadhere to them closely.&lt;br> A range of 414 hr is given for the IVT reaction incubation time (step II.F.3 on page 13). Refer to the graph in Figure 3 on page 7 to help determine what incubation time to use. Keep this IVT incubation time uniform if aRNA yield from different samples will be compared, or if you want to have equal amplification of different samples. Although differences in IVT incubation time among samples has had very little, if any, effect on array results in our hands, we still recommend using a uniform IVT incubation time for the most reproducible amplification and array analysis.&lt;br> &lt;br> Master Mixes&lt;br> &lt;br> We strongly recommend preparing master mixes for the MessageAmp II procedure. This approach reduces the effects of pipetting error, and improves reproducibility. Using Master Mixes is especially important when aRNA yield from different samples will be compared.  Ambion provides a web-based Master Mix calculator at the following address: &lt;br> &lt;br> www.ambion.com/techlib/append/msgamp2_mm_calc.php&lt;br> &lt;br> &lt;br> Thorough mixing is very important for reproducibility&lt;br> &lt;br> Below are specific instructions for mixing kit reagents, Master Mixes, and individual reactions. For maximum reproducibility and aRNA yield, follow these instructions closely. &lt;br>  Mix each kit component after thawing.&lt;br> &lt;br> Mix enzyme solutions by gently flicking the tube a few times before adding them to reactions. Thaw frozen reagents completely at room temperature (i.e. primers, nucleotides and 10 X buffers), then mix thoroughly by vortexing, and keep on ice before use.&lt;br>  Mix Master Mixes by gentle vortexing.&lt;br> &lt;br> After assembling Master Mixes, gently vortex to make a homogenous mixture without inactivating the enzyme(s).&lt;br> &lt;br>  Mix individual reactions by pipetting up and down 23 times, then flicking the tube 34 times, and finally spinning briefly.&lt;br> After adding Master Mixes or other reagents to individual reactions, pipet up and down 23 times to rinse reagents from the pipet tip. Then flick the tube with your finger 34 times to mix thoroughly, and finish by centrifuging briefly to collect the reaction at the bottom of the tube. &lt;br> &lt;br> Incubator recommendations&lt;br> &lt;br>  We recommend a calibrated hybridization oven or incubator (at constant temperature) for most of the MessageAmp II incubations.&lt;br> To avoid any potential influence on the reaction temperature from the tube holder, let tube holders equilibrate in the incubator for sufficient time, or use a tube holder that doesnt touch the sides and bottoms of the tubesfor example a floating tube support.&lt;br> &lt;br>  For the 16°C second strand synthesis reaction incubation (step II.D.2&lt;br> on page 11), we recommend using a thermal cycler&lt;br> . Ideally these reactions should be incubated in a calibrated thermal cycler with a lid temperature that matches the block temperature. Most machines do not have this feature, so if the lid temperature is static (~100°C), use it with the heat turned off, or do not use the heated lid at all. Otherwise heat from the lid will raise the temperature of the solution in the tube, compromising the reaction.&lt;br>  We do not recommend using heat blocks or water baths for MessageAmp II reaction incubations.&lt;br> The MessageAmp II procedure is very sensitive to temperature; therefore use incubators that have been professionally calibrated according the manufacturers recommended schedule. Variable or inaccurate incubation temperatures can limit aRNA synthesis. Preheat incubators if necessary so that the correct temperature has stabilized before reactions are placed in the incubator. It is also very important that condensation does&lt;br> not form in the reaction tubes during any of the incubations. Condensation changes the composition of reaction mixtures, and we have seen that it can greatly reduce yield.&lt;br> &lt;br> Maintaining consistency&lt;br> &lt;br> Procedural consistency is very important for planning amplification experiments. Consider implementing a detailed procedural plan that will be used by everyone in the lab to maintain consistency. This type of plan will minimize variation due to subtle procedural differences that can influence RNA amplification, and which may&lt;br> complicate gene expression studies. The plan should include basic information such as the method of RNA isolation, the amount of RNA to use in the procedure, and how long to incubate the IVT reaction. It should also address specifics that are not often included in protocols such as which tubes, tube racks, and incubators to use for each step in the process. Finally, develop a consistent work flow, for example standardize stopping points in the method. The idea is to standardize all of the variables discussed in this section of the Instruction Manual and carefully follow all the protocol steps in order to maximize amplification consistency among samples.&lt;br> &lt;br> Prepare the Wash Buffer&lt;br> &lt;br> Add 24 ml ACS grade 100% ethanol (ACS grade or better) to the bottle labeled aRNA Wash Buffer. Mix well and mark the label to indicate that the ethanol was added.&lt;br> &lt;br> Reverse Transcription to Synthesize First Strand cDNA&lt;br> &lt;br> Incubators needed:&lt;br>  70°C (thermal cycler recommended)&lt;br>  42°C (hybridization oven or incubator recommended)&lt;br> &lt;br> 1.

      <name>Genotying of human glioma cell lines reveals epigenetic-mediated dysfunction of the bmp pathway inhibits differentiation of human glioblastoma initiating cells</name>
      <description>Despite similarities between tumor initiating cells with stem-like properties (TICs) and normal neural stem cells, we hypothesized that there may be differences in their differentiation potentials. We now demonstrate that both bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-mediated and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)-mediated Jak/STAT-dependent astroglial differentiation is impaired due to EZH2-dependent epigenetic silencing of BMP receptor 1B (BMPR1B) in a subset of glioblastoma TICs. Forced expression of BMPR1B either by transgene expression or demethylation of the promoter restores their differentiation capabilities and induces loss of their tumorigenicity. We propose that deregulation of the BMP developmental pathway in a subset of glioblastoma TICs contributes to their tumorigenicity both by desensitizing TICs to normal differentiation cues, and by converting otherwise cytostatic signals to pro-proliferative signals. Experiment Overall Design: DNA extracted from four glioma cell lines were hybridized to 50K mapping arrays (Xba only) to detect and summarize chromosomal aberrations in those samples.</description>

      <name>Gene expression profiling in NCoR deficient mouse livers</name>
      <description>The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) has been proposed to regulate target genes in the absence of triiodothyronine (T3), through the recruitment of the corepressors, NCoR and SMRT. NCoR and SMRT may thus play a key role in both hypothyroidism and resistance to thyroid hormone, though this has never been tested in vivo. To accomplish this we developed mice that express in the liver a NCoR protein (L-NCoR∆ID) that cannot interact with the TR. L-NCoR∆ID mice develop normally, however when made hypothyroid the repression of many positively regulated T3-target genes is abrogated, demonstrating that NCoR plays a specific and sufficient role in repression by the unliganded TR. Remarkably, in the euthyroid state, expression of many T3-targets are also upregulated in L-NCoR∆ID mice, demonstrating that NCoR also determines the magnitude of the response to T3 in euthyroid animals. While positive T3 targets were upregulated in L-NCoR∆ID mice in the hypo and euthyroid state there was less effect seen on negatively regulated T3 target genes. Thus, NCoR is a specific regulator of T3-action in vivo and mediates the activity of the unliganded TR. Furthermore, NCoR may play a key role in determining the differences in individual responses to similar levels of circulating T3. Keywords: NCoR, thyroid hormone signaling, mouse liver,  DNA Microarray To better assess the role of NCoR in positive and negative regulation we performed micorarray analysis of gene expression in the livers of euthyroid and hypothyroid control and L-NCoR∆ID mice.</description>

      <name>Cooperative Signaling Through the STAT3 and NF-kB Pathways in Subtypes of DLBCL</name>
      <description>The activated B cell-like (ABC) subgroup of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is characterized by constitutive activation of the NF-êB pathway. Here we show that the NF- êB pathway induces the expression of the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 in ABC DLBCL cell lines, which also have high levels of total and phosphorylated STAT3 protein, suggesting autocrine signaling. Using RNA interference for STAT3, we defined a gene expression signature of IL-6 and IL-10 signaling through STAT3. Based on this signature, we constructed a molecular predictor of STAT3 signaling that defined a subset of ABC DLBCL tumors with high expression of STAT3, IL-6 and/or IL-10, and their downstream targets. Although the STAT3-high and STAT3-low subsets had equivalent expression of genes that distinguish ABC DLBCL from GCB DLBCL, STAT3-high ABC DLBCLs had higher expression of signatures that reflected NF-kB activity, proliferation, and glycolysis. A smallmolecule inhibitor of JAK signaling, which blocked STAT3 signature expression, was toxic only for ABC DLBCL lines, and synergized with an inhibitor of NF-kB signaling. These findings suggest that the biological interplay between the STAT3 and NF-kB pathways may be exploited for the treatments of a subset of ABC DLBCLs. Activated B cell-like (ABC) subgroup of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines were used as model systems to study the cytokine pathways in these cells. We expressed inducible IkB super-repressor for 1 to 24 hours to identify NF-kB target genes in OCI-Ly3 and OCI-Ly10 cells for a total of 13 arrays with replicates of each time point. We treated OCI-Ly3 cells with IL-10 for 1 to 96 hours for a total of 10 arrays with replicates of each time point. We treated OCI-Ly10 cells with IL-6 for 30 minutes to 24 hours for a total of 8 arrays with replicates of each time point. OCI-Ly10 cells transfected with no siRNA versus STAT3-siRNA for 8, 24, or 48 hours for a total of 5 arrays with replicates for 24 and 48 hours. We treated OCI-Ly10 cells with JAK inhibitor I for 3 and 6 hours for a total of 4 arrays with replicates of each time point.</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of IL-22-/- samples</name>
      <description>Infection by attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogens poses a serious threat to public health, as was highlighted by the recent outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 infection in the United States. Here, by using a murine A/E pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium, we demonstrate that C. rodentium infection is lethal to IL-22-/- mice within two weeks. IL-22, in the early phase of infection, is indispensable for preventing the invasion of bacteria through the intestinal epithelium, and thereby preventing systemic spread and mortality.  We also show that IL-23 is required for the early induction of IL-22 during C. rodentium infection. Finally, our data suggest that IL-22 exerts its function by boosting the innate immune responses of colonic epithelial cells, especially though the induction of anti-microbial proteins, RegIIIβ and RegIIIγ. Experiment Overall Design: Control or IL-22-treated mouse colon in triplicate.</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of Plasmodium falciparum after exposing drug-selected mutants to short term CQ treatment</name>
      <description>Mutations in PfCRT confer chloroquine (CQ) resistance in P. falciparum. Point mutations in the homolog of the mammalian multidrug resistance gene (pfmdr1) can also modulate the levels of CQ response. However, parasites with the same pfcrt and pfmdr1 alleles exhibit a wide range of drug sensitivity, suggesting that additional genes contribute to levels of CQ resistance (CQR). We used 3 isogenic lines which have different drug resistance profiles corresponding to unique mutations in the pfcrt gene (106/1K76, 106/176I, and 106/76I-352K) to study changes in gene expression with and without CQ and genomic variations, i.e. copy number (CN) changes. RNA transcription levels from 45 genes were significantly altered in one or both mutants relative to the parent line. Of particular interest are genes encoding proteins involved in transport and/or regulation of cytoplasmic or compartmental pH, e.g. the V-type H+ pumping pyrophosphatase 2, Ca2+/H+ antiporter VCX1 and copy number changes in pfmdr1. A series of deletion (including 15 genes) also occurred at the beginning of chromosome 10. Experiment Overall Design: Three isogenic parasite lines were treated with and without 3h CQ and synchronized for total RNA extraction and hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChips® to study gene expression profiles. Genomic DNA from mixed culture was also extracted and hybridized to the same Affymetrix GeneChips.

      <name>Fine-Scale Mapping and Sequencing of Structural Variation from Eight Human Genomes</name>
      <description>Genetic variation amongst individual humans occurs on many different scales, ranging from gross alterations in the human karyotype to single-nucleotide changes.  In this manuscript we explore variation on an intermediate scale-particularly insertions, deletions, and inversions affecting from a few thousand to a few million base pairs.  We employed a clone-based method to interrogate this intermediate structural variation in eight individuals of diverse geographic ancestry. Our analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the normal pattern of structural variation present in these genomes, refining the location of 1695 structural variants. We find that 50% were seen in more than one individual and that nearly half lay outside regions of the genome previously described as structurally variant. We discover 525 new insertion sequences that are not present in the human reference genome and show that many of these are variable in copy number among individuals. Sequencing of a subset of structural variants reveals considerable locus complexity and provides insights into the different mutational processes that have shaped the human genome. These data provide the first high-resolution sequence-map of human structural variation-an important standard for genotyping platforms and a prelude to future individual genome sequencing projects. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization The DNA samples are a panel of 8 Hapmap samples, described by E. Eichler et al. (2007, Nature 447, 161-165).  This set of 7 female, and one male samples are from from the Coriell Cell Repository, and is comprised of samples from four populations: four Yoruban, two CEPH, one Chinese, and one Japanese.  The reference sample, NA15510, is female and also from the Corriel Cell Repository.  This sample has been extensively characterized, (for example in Tuzan et al. 2005, Nature Genetics 10, p1038) and has been recommended for use in CNV detection programs to allow meaningful comparison of data between studies (discussed in Scherer, et al. 2007, Nature Genetics Supplement 39: S7-S15). Each of these samples was hybridized in pairs with the reversed labeling polarities.  Additionally, 3 self-self control hybridizations were carried out for the reference sample, NA15510, one on each hybridization date.</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of mouse Podocytes reveal use of FcRn to clear IgG from the glomerular basement membrane</name>
      <description>The glomerular filtration barrier prevents large serum proteins from being lost into the urine. It is not known, however, why the filter does not routinely clog with large proteins that enter the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Here we provide evidence that an active transport mechanism exists to remove immunoglobulins that accumulate at the filtration barrier. We found that FcRn, an IgG and albumin transport receptor, is expressed in podocytes and functions to internalize IgG from the GBM. Mice lacking FcRn accumulated IgG in the GBM as they aged and tracer studies showed delayed clearance of IgG from the kidneys of FcRn deficient mice. Supporting a role for this pathway in disease, saturating the clearance mechanism potentiated the pathogenicity of nephrotoxic sera. These studies support the idea that podocytes play an active role in removing proteins from the GBM and suggest that genetic or acquired impairment of the clearance machinery is likely to be a common mechanism promoting glomerular diseases. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA for genechip analysis was derived from two sources: Experiment Overall Design: 1) Primary mouse podocytes isolated by FACS sorting of collagenase digested glomeruli Experiment Overall Design: 2) In vitro differentiated conditionally immortalized mouse podocyte cell line. Experiment Overall Design: After obtaining genechip data, the expression of various IgG and albumin receptors was queried in the genechip data and then confirmed by RT-PCR.</description>

      <name>Genomic expression profiling of TNFalpha treated BDC2.5 diabetogenic CD4+ T Cells</name>
      <description>Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) plays an important role in immune regulation, inflammation, and autoimmunity.  Chronic TNFalpha exposure has been shown to down-modulate T cell responses.  In a mouse T cell hybridoma model, TNFalpha attenuated T cell receptor (TCR) signaling.  We have confirmed that chronic TNFalpha and anti-TNFalpha exposure suppressed and increased T cell responses in BDC2.5 CD4+ T cells, respectively.  The goal of this study is to analyze global transcriptional alterations resulting from TNFalpha treatment on TCR signaling pathways using cDNA microarrays.  We found that genes involved in functional categories including T cell signaling, cell cycle, proliferation, ubiquitination, cytokine synthesis, calcium signaling, and apoptosis were modulated.  Genes such as ubiquitin family genes, cytokine inducible SH2-containing genes, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21, p57, calmodulin family genes (calmodulin -V1, -V2, and ?V3) and calcium channel voltage- dependent, N type alpha1B subunit (CaV2.2) were induced by TNFalpha, while Vav2, Rho GTPase activating protein, calcium channel voltage dependent, L type alpha 1C subunit (CaV1.2), interleukin-1 (IL) receptor-associated kinase 1, and -V2 (IRAK-1and -2) and IL enhancer binding factor 3 were reduced by TNFalpha.  Genes such as CaV1.2 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, repressed by TNFalpha, were induced by anti-TNF treatment.  Further, we showed that chronic TNFalpha exposure impaired NF-kappaB and AP-1 transactivation activity, leading to T cell unresponsiveness.  Thus, our results present a detailed picture of transcriptional programs affected by chronic TNFalpha exposure, and provide candidate target genes, which may function to mediate TNFalpha induced T cell unresponsiveness. Set of arrays that are part of repeated experiments Keywords: Biological Replicate The experiments addressed the effect of TNF exposure.  8-12-week-old NOD.BDC2.5 transgenic mice were injected i.p. with PBS or 3 ug murine TNFalpha; on alternate days for three weeks.  At day 24 of treatment, suspensions of LNs and/or splenocytes were stimulated with the indicated concentration of the mimotope (1047-7 peptide (YVAPVWVRME)) at a density of 7-8 x 106 cells/ml, in a final volume of 1 ml in 24-well plates.  After prolonged in vitro culture, cells were harvested 12 hrs post transplantation.  CD4+ T cells were purified by labeling of monoclonal Abs of surface markers, Vbeta4-FITC and CD4-PE and enriched by Magnetic beads selection followed by FACS sorting.  The purity of CD4+ T cells ranged from 95% to 99% depending on individual CD4 T cells preparation.  The data in column represents six independent repeated experiments with half of the slides being reverse replicates.  We compared RNA from PBE treated group with TNF treated group without including reference RNA.</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of maizeduring infection with Ustilago maydis</name>
      <description>The fungal pathogen Ustilago maydis establishes a biotrophic relationship with its host plant maize. Hallmarks of the disease are large plant tumors in which fungal proliferation occurs. Plants have developed various defense pathways to cope with pathogens. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression during the infection process of Ustilago maydis in its host plant to get insights into the defense programs and the metabolic reprogramming needed to supply the fungus with nutrients. Experiment Overall Design: In three independent experiments plants were infected with the solopathogenic U. maydis  strain SG200. Samples from infected leaves were taken at 12 and 24 hours post infection, as well as 2, 4 and 8 days post infection. Samples from uninfected control plants were taken at the same time points.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - Maize plants of the cultivar Early Golden Bantam were grown in a phytochamber in a 15 h / 9 h light-dark cycle; light period started with a  continuous increase from 0% to 100% light for 1h, and ended 13h later with a continuous decrease from 100% to 0% light for 1 h. Temperature was 28Â&amp;deg;C and 20Â&amp;deg;C, relative humidity 40% and 60% during light and dark periods, respectively, with a 1 h ramping for both values. Plantlets were individually sown in pots with potting soil (Fruhstorfer Pikiererde) to avoid shading of the plants.
 Sample Processing - U. maydis strain SG200 (Nature 444:97-101) was grown in liquid culture overnight to an OD600 of 1.0, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in water to an OD600 of 3.0; compatible strains were mixed in equal amounts immediately before infection; 0.2 ml of cell suspension mixes were injected into the leaf whorl of 6â"7-day-old corn plants (as described in Mol Microbiology 42:1047-1063). Plants were infected 7 days after sowing 1 h before end of the light period with the exception of the 12 hpi samples were plants were infected during the beginning of the light period.
 Hybridization - Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45Â&amp;deg;C on GeneChip Maize Genome Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400 (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix)
 Labeling - Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 1 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - For RNA isolation, material from 30 plants was pooled and subsequently ground in liquid nitrogen by mortar and pestle. RNA was extracted from the powder with Trizol (Invitrogen) and purified using the Qiagen RNeasy kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, respectively.

The intensity values of each spot were measured and then normalized using LOWESS (LocFit Normalization – mode: global) and Interlog Mean (Interactive Log Mean Centering Normalization) using the default settings, but with the following modification: one bad channel tolerance: generous; followed by in-slide replicate analysis using TIGR MIDAS software (http://www.tm4.org/midas.html). Spots that were flagged as faulty, due to either low intensity values or signal saturation, were automatically discarded. Final statistical analysis was carried out using BRB array tools (http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html). A total of 1902 genes passed the filtering criteria after the analysis by the BRB software. Class prediction was then, determined at p value of 0.005.

      <name>Transcription profiling of human 3D cultured chrondrocytes treated with supernatant of synovial fibroblasts from an RA patients vs controls to investigate key regulatory molecules of cartilage destruction in rheumatoid arthritis</name>
      <description>We have studied the expression profile of 3D cultured human chondrocytes that were stimulated with supernatant of synovial fibroblasts derived from a RA patient (RASF=HSE cell line) and from a normal donor (NDSF=K4IM cell line), respectively. For this purpose, passage 2 human chondrocytes were cultured for 14 days in alginate beads and subsequently stimulated for 48 hours with supernatant of RASF and NDSF. Baseline expression was determined of unstimulated chondrocytes. Differential genome-wide microarray analysis of RASF and NDSF stimulated chondrocytes disclosed a distinct expression profile related to cartilage destruction  involving marker genes of inflammation (COX-2), NF-kappa B signaling pathway (TLR2), cytokines/chemokines and receptors (CXCL1-3, CCL20, CXCL8, CXCR4, IL-6, IL-1beta), matrix degradation (MMP-10, MMP-12) and suppressed matrix synthesis (COMP). Thus, transcriptome profiling of RASF and NDSF stimulated chondrocytes revealed a disturbed catabolic-anabolic homeostasis of chondrocyte function. This study provides a comprehensive insight into the molecular regulatory processes induced in human chondrocytes during RA-related cartilage destruction. Experiment Overall Design: To reveal the RA-related chondrocyte gene expression profile, genome-wide microarray analysis of RASF stimulated human chondrocytes compared to NDSF stimulation was performed. Unstimulated chondrocytes were analyzed for baseline gene expression. For microarray analysis of RASF and NDSF stimulated and unstimulated chondrocytes, respectively, two RNA pools were analyzed, each pool consisting of equal amounts of RNA from three different donors.</description>

      <name>Fine-Scale Mapping and Sequencing of Structural Variation from Eight Human Genomes</name>
      <description>Genetic variation amongst individual humans occurs on many different scales, ranging from gross alterations in the human karyotype to single-nucleotide changes.  In this manuscript we explore variation on an intermediate scale-particularly insertions, deletions, and inversions affecting from a few thousand to a few million base pairs.  We employed a clone-based method to interrogate this intermediate structural variation in eight individuals of diverse geographic ancestry. Our analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the normal pattern of structural variation present in these genomes, refining the location of 1695 structural variants. We find that 50% were seen in more than one individual and that nearly half lay outside regions of the genome previously described as structurally variant. We discover 525 new insertion sequences that are not present in the human reference genome and show that many of these are variable in copy number among individuals. Sequencing of a subset of structural variants reveals considerable locus complexity and provides insights into the different mutational processes that have shaped the human genome. These data provide the first high-resolution sequence-map of human structural variation-an important standard for genotyping platforms and a prelude to future individual genome sequencing projects. Keywords: comparitive genomic hybridization, copy number variation, structural variation, fosmid end sequencing CGH analysis targeted against sites identified by fosmid end sequencing.  8 HapMap samples (sources of libraries ABC7-ABC14) are hybed against NA15510 (source of fosmid library G248).</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) or horse ATG (hATG)</name>
      <description>We performed microarray to compare gene expression patterns of PBMC treated with rATG or hATG. Fold changes were compared using 2-way ANOVA tests for untreated, rATG- and hATG-treated PBMC. In PBMC treated with 10 ug/mL rATG, compared with untreated PBMC, 478 genes showed up-regulation, and 341 genes showed down-regulation at 24 hours using 10% FDR and 2-fold change cutoff. Immediately striking was that 10 ug/mL hATG had affected many fewer genes than did rATG: only 3 genes were up-regulated and 6 genes were down-regulated at 24 hours in hATG-treated PBMC.  When we compared rATG with hATG, rATG induced up-regulation of 268 genes and down-regulation of 95 genes. These genes belong to the categories of immune response (64 genes), cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (36 genes), regulation of cell proliferation (24 genes), cell cycle (23 genes), cell growth (8 genes), apoptosis (7 genes), and others. Experiment Overall Design: PBMC from healthy controls were cultured with rATG or hATG (each at 10 ug/mL) in 10% FCS/RPMI 1640 at 37C for 24 hours, PBMC without drugs were used as controls.  Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).  RNA purity was assessed by spectrophotometry.  Probes were prepared using standard Affymetrix protocols and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133A 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)</description>

      <name>A compendium of antibiotic-induced transcription profiles reveals broad regulation of P. multocida virulence genes</name>
      <description>Treatment of bacteria with antibiotics at or close to the inhibitory concentration leads to specific transcriptional responses often affecting target genes and targets pathways. A dataset of transcriptional profiles (compendium) induced by antibiotics with known mode-of-action (MoA) can be used to gain information on the putative MoA of novel substances with unknown MoAs. We used a Pasteurella multocida microarray to generate a compendium of transcriptional profiles and to obtain information on the putative MoA of a novel antibiotic compound. We also show a strong impact of the bacteriostatic antibiotics on P. multocida virulence gene transcription. Keywords: antibiotica treatment, time course Midlog-grown cultures of P. multocida were treated for 10 or 30 min with 8 different antibiotics and one novel compound (thiazin) at minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and were harvested. Control bacteria were not-treated and harvested at approximately the same optical density an OD578 of ~ 0.5. Total RNA was extracted from these samples and labelled with biotin. P. multocida whole genome transcriptional profiling was performed by hybridization on the custom-made Affymetrix microarray according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The experiments were done in triplicates.</description>

      <description>We report here a transcriptonal analysis in six different organ types of a approximately 1 Mb region in soybean (Glycine max) which is sytenic with legume (Medicago truncatula). We used oligonucleotide tiling microarrays to detecte transcription of over 80% of the predicted genes in both species. We detected differential gene expression in the six examined organ types. Keywords: RNA Both the barrel medic and soybean tiling arrays were produced on the Maskless Array Synthesizer platform. Briefly, tiling-paths consisting of 36-mer oligonucleotides offset by five nucleotides were designed to represent both DNA strands of the selected barrel medic and soybean genome sequence. Probes were synthesized at a feature-density of 390,000 probes per array in a “chess board” design. Microarray production and storage were carried out. Total RNA and mRNA were sequentially isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and the Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, respectively. mRNA from different organ types was reverse transcribed using a mixture of oligo(dT)18 and random nonamer primers, during which amino-allyl-modified dUTP (aa-dUTP) was incoporated. The aa-dUTP decorated cDNA was fluorescent labeled by conjugating the monofunctional Cy3 dye (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) to the amino-allyl functional groups in the cDNA.

      <name>Transcription profiling of human leukemia U937 cells response to mild hypothermia</name>
      <description>The rationale underlying hyperthermia is the fact that temperatures over 42.5˚C are highly cytotoxic to tumor cells. On the other hand, although mild hyperthermia at a range from 39 to 41˚C alone did not induce cytotoxicity in tumor cells, mild hyperthermia is reported to show a synergism with radiotherapy and anti-cancer drugs. Here, the effects of mild hyperthermia (41˚C for 30 min) on the gene expression in human lymphoma U937 cells were investigated using by an Affymetrix GeneChip system. Although the cells treated with the mild hyperthermia did not induce apoptosis, a significant increase in protein levels of heat shock proteins, Hsp40 and Hsp70, was observed following activation of heat shock factor-1. At 3 h post-treatment, 938 probe sets that were differentially expressed by >1.5-fold were identified. Experiment Overall Design: U937 cells, a human lymphoma cell line, were treated with mild hyperthermia (41˚C for 30 min) and followed by incubation for 3 h at 37°C. Non-treated cells were served as control. Total RNA samples were prepared from the cells. Gene expression was analyzed by an Affymetrix GeneChip® system with Human Expression Array U133A which was spotted with 22,283 probe sets. Sample preparation for array hybridization was carried out as described in the manufacture’s instructions.</description>

      <name>Identification of human minor H antigens based on genotyping of pooled DNA</name>
      <description>Minor histocompatibility (H) antigens are the molecular targets of allo-immunity responsible both for the development of anti-tumor effects and for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).  However, despite their potential clinical use, our knowledge of human minor H antigens is largely limited by the lack of efficient methods of their characterization.  Here we report a robust and efficient method of minor H gene discovery that combines whole genome association scans (WGAS) with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) assays, in which the genetic loci of minor H genes recognized by the CTL clones are precisely identified using pooled-DNA analysis of immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines with/without susceptibility to those CTLs.  Using this method, we have successfully mapped two loci: one previously characterized (HMSD encoding ACC-6), and one novel.  The novel minor H antigen encoded by the BCL2A1 was identified within a 26 kb linkage disequilibrium block on chromosome 15q25, which had been directly mapped by WGAS.  The pool size required to identify these regions was no more than 100 individuals.  Thus, once CTL clones are generated, this method should substantially facilitate discovery of minor H antigens applicable to targeted allo-immune therapies and also contribute to our understanding of human allo-immunity. Keywords: pooled DNA, minor histocompatibility antigen, genotype array For CTL-2A12, we collected 44 cytotoxicity-positive (CTX+) and 44 cytotoxicity-negative (CTX-) B-LCLs. For  CTL-1B9, 57 CTX+ and 38 CTX- B-LCLs were collected. Pools of DNA were generated and subjected to analysis on Affymetrix® GeneChip® 100K and 500K microarrays in duplicates.Genetic mapping of the minor H locus was performed by identifying marker SNPs that showed statistically significant deviations in allele-frequencies between CTX+ and CTX- pools based on the observed allele-specific signals in the microarray experiments.</description>

      <name>The Epstein-Barr Virus latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) induces cellular microRNA146a</name>
      <description>The Epstein Barr virus (EBV) encoded latent membrane protein-1 (LMP1) is a functional homologue of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and contributes substantially to the oncogenic potential of EBV through activation of Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNA molecules that are involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as growth, development, and apoptosis, and have recently been linked to cancer phenotypes. Through miRNA microarray analysis, we demonstrate that LMP1 dysregulates the expression of several cellular miRNAs, including the most highly regulated of these, miR-146a. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed induced expression of miR-146a by LMP1. Analysis of miR-146a expression in EBV latency type III and type I cell lines revealed substantial expression of miR-146a in type III (which express LMP1) but not in type I cell lines. Reporter studies demonstrated that LMP1 induces miR-146a predominantly through two NF-kappaB binding sites in the miR-146a promoter and identified a role for an OCT-1 site in conferring basal and induced expression. Array analysis of cellular mRNAs expressed in Akata cells transduced with an miR-146a expressing retrovirus identified genes that are directly or indirectly regulated by miR-146a, including a group of interferon responsive genes that are inhibited by miR-146a. Since miR-146a is known to be induced by agents that activate the interferon response pathway (including LMP1), these results suggest that miR-146a functions in a negative feedback loop to modulate the intensity and/or duration of the interferon response. Keywords: Analysis of gene expression changes altered by the microRNA, miR-146a EBV positive Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, Akata, was infected with the control retrovirus, pEhyg, or the miR-146a expressing retrovirus, pEhyg-miR-146a.  Two infections were carried out for control retrovirus and two infections were carried out with the pEhyg-miR-146a retrovirus.  Total RNA was prepared from each of the 4 infections.  Control and miR-146a infection set 1 was subjected to dual color array analysis on chip 1.  Control and miR-146a infection set 2 was subjected to dual color array analysis on second array of chip 1.  Dye swaps of each of these were carried out on two arrays from a second chip (chip 2).</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of mouse NUP98-NSD1 transformed samples reveals NUP98-NSD1 links H3K36 methylation to Hox-A gene activation and leukaemogenesis. INCOMPLETE DATASET</name>
      <description>Nuclear receptor-binding SET domain protein 1 (NSD1) prototype is a family of mammalian histone methyltransferases (NSD1, NSD2/MMSET/WHSC1, NSD3/WHSC1L1) that are essential in development and are mutated in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), overgrowth syndromes, multiple myeloma and lung cancers. In AML, the recurring t(5;11)(q35;p15.5) translocation fuses NSD1 to nucleoporin-98 (NUP98). Here, we present the first characterization of the transforming properties and molecular mechanisms of NUP98-NSD1. We demonstrate that NUP98-NSD1 induces AML in vivo, sustains self-renewal of myeloid stem cells in vitro, and enforces expression of the HoxA7, HoxA9, HoxA10 and Meis1 proto-oncogenes. Mechanistically, NUP98-NSD1 binds genomic elements adjacent to HoxA7 and HoxA9, maintains histone H3 Lys 36 (H3K36) methylation and histone acetylation, and prevents EZH2-mediated transcriptional repression of the Hox-A locus during differentiation. Deletion of the NUP98 FG-repeat domain, or mutations in NSD1 that inactivate the H3K36 methyltransferase activity or that prevent binding of NUP98-NSD1 to the Hox-A locus precluded both Hox-A gene activation and myeloid progenitor immortalization. We propose that NUP98-NSD1 prevents EZH2-mediated repression of Hox-A locus genes by colocalizing H3K36 methylation and histone acetylation at regulatory DNA elements. This report is the first to link deregulated H3K36 methylation to tumorigenesis and to link NSD1 to transcriptional regulation of the Hox-A locus. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was extracted from stably transformed progenitors cultured in vitro and the expression levels of mRNA transcripts quantified using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array, as previously described. The GEO database accession numbers: for progenitors immortalized by HoxA9 (GSM190542, GSM190546, GSM190547); for progenitors immortalized by coexpressed HoxA9 plus Meis1 (GSM190548, GSM190549, GSM190550); for progenitors immortalized by NUP98-NSD1 (GSM190551, GSM190552, GSM190553); and for progenitors immortalized by MLL-ENL (GSM190554).

      <name>Transcription profiling of S. cerevisiae response to the antifungal compound sampangine</name>
      <description>Sampangine, a plant-derived alkaloid found in the Annonaceae family, exhibits strong inhibitory activity against the opportunistic fungal pathogens Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus.  In the present study, transcriptional profiling experiments coupled with the analysis of mutants were performed in an effort to elucidate its mechanism of action.  Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, we show that sampangine produces a transcriptional response indicative of hypoxia, altering the expression of genes known to respond to low oxygen conditions.  Several additional lines of evidence obtained suggest that these responses could involve effects on heme.   First, the hem1 deletion mutant lacking the first enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway showed increased sensitivity to sampangine, and exogenously supplied hemin partially rescued the inhibitory activity of sampangine in wild-type cells.  In addition, heterozygous mutants with deletions in genes involved in five out of eight steps in the heme biosynthetic pathway showed increased susceptibility to sampangine.  Furthermore, spectral analysis of pyridine extracts indicated significant accumulation of free porphyrins in sampangine-treated cells.  Transcriptional profiling experiments were also performed in C. albicans to investigate the response of a pathogenic fungal species to sampangine.  Taking into account the known differences in the physiological responses of C. albicans and S. cerevisiae to low oxygen, significant correlations were observed between the two transcription profiles suggestive of heme-related defects.  Our results indicate that the antifungal activity of the plant alkaloid sampangine is due, at least in part, to perturbations in the biosynthesis or metabolism of heme. Experiment Overall Design: S. cerevisiae S288C cells at OD 0.2 were treated with either sampangine (SMP) at IC50 concentration (1.17 ug/ml), or solvent (0.25% DMSO), allowed to grow to OD 0.5, then harvested and frozen.  Three biological replicate samples were analyzed for each treatment.</description>

      <name>Oxidative stress transcriptome of japonica rice</name>
      <description>Regulation of gene expression by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important component of abiotic stress signal transduction mechanisms.  Previous genome-wide analysis of chilling-induced changes in gene expression suggested a potential role of H2O2 and other ROS as key signals in the induction of early response genes in japonica rice (cv. Nipponbare). Candidate regulators including bZIP-, Myb- or WRKY-types of transcription factors that were responsive to both chilling (10oC) and exogenous H2O2, and their probable target clusters (as1/ocs/TGA1-like, MybR-like element containing genes) were inferred by integrative analysis of qPCR expression profiles and ab initio promoter motif data.  In an effort to define the composition and hierarchical organization of the ROS-mediated chilling response regulatory networks, we examined the effect of exogenous H2O2 (6 hours in 4mM H2O2 at 28oC and then 6 hours of recovery in water at 28oC) on the transcriptome of Nipponbare in a genome-wide scale and compared them with the chilling stress transcriptome.  Results of this study were consistent with our earlier model that a ROSbZIP-as1/ocs/TGA1 regulatory module is a direct consequence of chilling-induced elevation of intracellular ROS during the initial 24 hours.  Keywords: time course (response to exogenous H2O2) This experiment describes the analysis of the temporal changes in gene expression in response to exogenous H2O2 in Nipponbare rice. A total of 5 treatment regimes were examined (1, 3, and 6 hours at 4 mM H2O2 and then 3 and 6 hours of recovery in water after 6 hours of exposure to H2O2).   The microarray platform used in this study was the 45K oligonucleotide microarray (www.ricearray.org) which comes in pairs of slides A and B (each containing about 50% of the total number of features). The data described in this series include all hybridizations with slide A and with slide B. All experiments were performed with two independent biological replicates (R1 and R2) for each time point.</description>

 Feature Extraction - Quality flagging was performed on the microarray scans using GenePix Pro 5.1. A complex quality control query was used to identify and select high quality spots (features) from the entire microarray matrix. This query was formulated to exclude features that belong to any of the following filter criteria: 1) The feature intensity is near background level; 2) The feature is irregular or not uniform (spotting irregularity); and 3) The background around the feature is not uniform (hybridization irregularity). Only the features that passed these stringent filter criteria were included in subsequent bioinformatics analysis of the gene expression data. Gene expression data in each image was normalized globally prior to high level analysis. VALUES represent the log of the ratio between the background subtracted intensity values at Cy5 (635 nm) and Cy3 (532 nm) (635/532). Data sorting was performed by MS Access. All high level (T-tests and hierarchical clustering) analyses were performed with the MeV Bioinformatics tools (TIGR).

      <name>Transcription profiling of mouse liver from wild-type or genetically deleted AHRs were treated with corn oil vehicle or TCDD reveals aryl hydrocarbon receptor regulates distinct dioxin-dependent and dioxin-independent gene batteries</name>
      <description>Conventional biochemical and molecular techniques identified previously several genes whose expression is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). We sought to map the complete spectrum of AHR-dependent genes in male adult liver using expression arrays to contrast mRNA profiles in Ahr-null mice (Ahr–/–) with those in mice with wild-type AHR (Ahr+/+). Transcript profiles were determined both in untreated mice and in mice treated 19 h earlier with 1000 µg/kg 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Expression of 456 ProbeSets was significantly altered by TCDD in an AHR-dependent manner, including members of the classic AHRE-I gene battery, such as Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp1b1, and Nqo1. In the absence of exogenous ligand, AHR status alone affected expression of 392 ProbeSets, suggesting that the AHR has multiple functions in normal physiology. In Ahr–/– mice, only 32 ProbeSets exhibited responses to TCDD, indicating that the AHR is required for virtually all transcriptional responses to dioxin exposure in liver. The flavin-containing monooxygenases, Fmo2 and Fmo3, considered previously to be uninducible, were highly induced by TCDD in an AHR-dependent manner. The estrogen receptor alpha as well as two estrogen-receptor-related genes (alpha and gamma) exhibit AHR-dependent expression, thereby extending cross-talk opportunities between the intensively studied AHR and estrogen receptor pathways. p53 binding sites are over-represented in genes down-regulated by TCDD, suggesting that TCDD inhibits p53 transcriptional activity. Overall, our study identifies a wide range of genes that depend on the AHR, either for constitutive expression or for response to TCDD. Experiment Overall Design: Mice bearing wild-type or genetically deleted AHRs were treated with corn oil vehicle or TCDD, and their livers analyzed by expression arrays.</description>

      <name>ENCODE spikein, amplified DNA samples, NimbleGen arrays</name>
      <description>The goals of the study were to assess array platform performance and analysis algorithm performance.  The most widely used method for detecting genome-wide protein-DNA interactions is chromatin immunoprecipitation on tiling microarrays, commonly known as ChIP-chip. Here, we conducted the first objective analysis of tiling array platforms, amplification procedures, and signal detection algorithms in a simulated ChIP-chip experiment. Mixtures of human genomic DNA and "spike-ins" comprised of nearly 100 human sequences at various concentrations were hybridized to four tiling array platforms by eight independent groups. Blind to the number of spike-ins, their locations, and the range of concentrations, each group made predictions of the spike-in locations. We found that microarray platform choice is not the primary determinant of overall performance. In fact, variation in performance between labs, protocols and algorithms within the same array platform was greater than the variation in performance between array platforms. However, each array platform had unique performance characteristics that varied with tiling resolution and the number of replicates, which have implications for cost versus detection power. Long oligonucleotide arrays were slightly more sensitive at detecting very low enrichment. On all platforms, simple sequence repeats and genome redundancy tended to result in false positives. LM-PCR and WGA, the most popular sample amplification techniques, reproduced relative enrichment levels with high fidelity. Performance among signal detection algorithms was heavily dependent on array platform.

      <name>Gene expression response to the antifungal compound sampangine in C. albicans</name>
      <description>Sampangine, a plant-derived alkaloid found in the Annonaceae family, exhibits strong inhibitory activity against the opportunistic fungal pathogens Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus.  In the present study, transcriptional profiling experiments coupled with the analysis of mutants were performed in an effort to elucidate its mechanism of action.  Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, we show that sampangine produces a transcriptional response indicative of hypoxia, altering the expression of genes known to respond to low oxygen conditions.  Several additional lines of evidence obtained suggest that these responses could involve effects on heme.   First, the hem1 deletion mutant lacking the first enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway showed increased sensitivity to sampangine, and exogenously supplied hemin partially rescued the inhibitory activity of sampangine in wild-type cells.  In addition, heterozygous mutants with deletions in genes involved in five out of eight steps in the heme biosynthetic pathway showed increased susceptibility to sampangine.  Furthermore, spectral analysis of pyridine extracts indicated significant accumulation of free porphyrins in sampangine-treated cells.  Transcriptional profiling experiments were also performed in C. albicans to investigate the response of a pathogenic fungal species to sampangine.  Taking into account the known differences in the physiological responses of C. albicans and S. cerevisiae to low oxygen, significant correlations were observed between the two transcription profiles suggestive of heme-related defects.  Our results indicate that the antifungal activity of the plant alkaloid sampangine is due, at least in part, to perturbations in the biosynthesis or metabolism of heme. C. albicans SC5314 cells at OD 0.2 were treated with either sampangine (SMP) at IC50 concentration (6.13 ug/ml), or solvent (0.25% DMSO), allowed to grow to OD 0.5, then harvested and frozen.  Three biological replicate samples were analyzed for each treatment.</description>

      <name>ENCODE spikein, nonamplified DNA samples, NimbleGen arrays</name>
      <description>The goals of the study were to assess array platform performance and analysis algorithm performance.  The most widely used method for detecting genome-wide protein-DNA interactions is chromatin immunoprecipitation on tiling microarrays, commonly known as ChIP-chip. Here, we conducted the first objective analysis of tiling array platforms, amplification procedures, and signal detection algorithms in a simulated ChIP-chip experiment. Mixtures of human genomic DNA and "spike-ins" comprised of nearly 100 human sequences at various concentrations were hybridized to four tiling array platforms by eight independent groups. Blind to the number of spike-ins, their locations, and the range of concentrations, each group made predictions of the spike-in locations. We found that microarray platform choice is not the primary determinant of overall performance. In fact, variation in performance between labs, protocols and algorithms within the same array platform was greater than the variation in performance between array platforms. However, each array platform had unique performance characteristics that varied with tiling resolution and the number of replicates, which have implications for cost versus detection power. Long oligonucleotide arrays were slightly more sensitive at detecting very low enrichment. On all platforms, simple sequence repeats and genome redundancy tended to result in false positives. LM-PCR and WGA, the most popular sample amplification techniques, reproduced relative enrichment levels with high fidelity.

      <description>This study used microarray expression analysis to identify global changes in transcript alteration in response to MEK inhibition. Genes under ERK control were identified in a panel of V600E BRAF and RTK-activated tumor cells and xenografts, using short-term inhibition of ERK activity using the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 (Pfizer). Experiment Overall Design: Cell lines growing in culture (n=12) and murine xenografts (n=2) were treated with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 or vehicle alone as control. Paired analysis of MEK inhibited to control samples was performed for two groups of tumor cells, V600E BRAF and RTK.  Time course analysis was performed on one representative cell line in order to first determine the optimal time point to detect changes in all cell lines.</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of a rat resistant model - Dioxin lethality: aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-mediated gene expression</name>
      <description>Major toxicities of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) result from dysregulation of gene expression mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).  Dioxin-like chemicals alter expression of numerous genes in liver but the specific genes whose dysregulation leads to toxicities such as wasting, hepatotoxicity and lethality have not been identified.  We searched for genes that are most likely to be key to dioxin toxicity by using gene expression arrays to contrast hepatic gene expression after TCDD treatment in dioxin-sensitive rats (that carry wildtype AHR) with gene expression in H/W(Kuopio) rats which are highly resistant to dioxin toxicity due to a major deletion in the AHR's transactivation domain (TAD).  The total number of TCDD-responsive genes was smaller in rats with the AHRH/W genotype than in rats with wildtype AHR.  However, genes in the classic AH gene battery such as CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 remained fully responsive to TCDD in AHRH/W rats; thus the TAD deletion selectively interferes with expression of a subset of hepatic genes rather than abolishing global AHR-mediated responses. Genes in the following functional categories differ in response to TCDD between dioxin-sensitive rats and dioxin-resistant rats: fatty acid  oxidation, metabolism (xenobiotic, alcohol, amino  acid,  and fatty  acid), phosphate transport, regulation of  steroid  biosynthesis, nitrogen compound  catabolism, and generation of  precursor  metabolites  and  energy.  Many of these differentially-responsive genes are integral parts of pathways such as: protein degradation and synthesis, fatty acid metabolism and synthesis, cytokinesis, cell growth, and apoptosis which may be part of mechanisms which lead to TCDD-induced wasting, hepatotoxicity, tumors, and death. These differentially-responsive genes are worthy candidates for further mechanistic studies to test their role in mediating or protecting from major dioxin toxicities. Experiment Overall Design: Four strains of rats were either treated with 100 ug/kg TCDD or cornoil vehicle and profiled at 19 hours, each with four replicates. Two strains were also analyzed at 3 hours, each with four replicates.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this experiment was to identify oestrogen regulated genes in human primary cell cultures of neuronal and glial cells modelling the developing human nervous system. We were especially interested in genes involved in proliferation, differentiation and migration of neuronal cells and genes involved in or linked to neurodegenerative diseases. We have therefore assessed gene expression changes, using Affymetrix GeneChips (HG-U133A), of oestrogen treated human neuronal/ glial cell cultures. We continued with 14 selected genes and confirmed the gene expression changes, by relative quantitative real time PCR, of 6 genes (p&lt; 0.05) important in neuronal development, three of which also are suggested to have links to neurodegenerative diseases.  Experiment Overall Design: Primary mixed neuronal/glial cell cultures were established from human brain tissue, which was obtained from 8-12 weeks old fetuses at legal abortion after informed consent from the patients. Procedures were approved by the local Ethics committee at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm. A total of 23 tissue samples yielding 9 cell cultures were used in this experiment. Half of the cell cultures were treated with 2µM β-oestradiol the day after seeding. The duration of the oestrogen treatment was 7 days and the cells were harvested after 8 days of culturing for RNA extraction. Extracted RNA from untreated respectively oestrogen treated cell cultures were pooled yileding two samples, which were each hybridised to Affymetrix microarrys. In this study oestrogen treatment of human neuronal/glial cell cultures was found to regulate 6 genes important in the development of the nervous system.</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of S. cerevisiae unfolding response</name>
      <description>The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes stress and induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) which is characterised in part by the transcriptional induction of genes involved in assisting protein folding. Translational responses to ER stress have been less well described and here we report on a genome-wide analysis of translational regulation in the response to the ER stress-inducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although the observed polysome profiles were similar under control and ER stress conditions microarray analysis identified transcipt-specific translational regulation. Genes with functions in ribosomal biogenesis and assembly were translationally repressed under ER stress. In contrast mRNAs for known UPR genes, including the UPR transcription factor HAC1, the ER-oxidoreductase ERO1 and the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) gene DER1 were enriched in polysomal fractions under ER stress conditions. In addition, we show that splicing of HAC1 mRNA is required for efficient ribosomal loading and that Gcn2p is required for normal HAC1 splicing, so shedding light on the role of this protein kinase in the UPR pathway. Experiment Overall Design: Polyribosomes were extracted from S. cerevisiae cells treated with 2 mM DTT or water (control), and fractionated according to ribosome loading. Following RNA purification from these fractions, for each sub-polysomal and polysomal RNA sample, fractions from three independent extracts per treatment (DTT/control) were pooled.</description>

 Sample Processing - 100 mL cultures were grown to OD600nm 0.5, when DTT was added to a final concentration of 2mM (or an equivalent volume of water was added to control cultures), and flasks were returned to the incubator for a further 1 hour. Cyclohexomide was added to a final concentration of 0.1mg/mL, and flasks were cooled immediately on ice.
 Hybridization - Fluidics Station Protocol. 
 Labeling - Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 5 μg total RNA (Affymetrix Manual II).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Cells were spun down (6000rpm, 4mins, 4oC), and washed twice in 2.5 mL lysis buffer (20mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 140mM KCl, 1.5mM MgCl2, 0.5mM DTT, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 0.1mg/mL cycloheximide, 1mg/mL heparin). Following resuspension in 0.7 mL lysis buffer, cells were transferred to a chilled 15 mL corex tube, and 0.5 mL chilled glass beads (0.45-0.55mm) were added. Cells were vortexed 4 times for 20 secs each, with 90 secs on ice between. Cells were then spun (5000rpm, 5 mins, 4oC), and the supernatant was transferred to a chilled 1.5 mL tube, and spun again (9500rpm, 5 mins, 4oC). The supernatant was loaded onto an 11 mL 15-60% sucrose gradient, prepared in 20mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 140mM KCl, 5mM MgCl2, 0.5mM DTT, 0.1mg/mL cycloheximide, 0.5mg/mL heparin, in a 12 mL ultra-clear tube (Beckman).

Using a programmable density gradient system (ISCO), 0.5 mL fractions were collected from the sucrose gradients into 1.5 mL tubes containing 1 mL of 6M guanidine HCl, mixed by inversion and immediately chilled on ice. Fractions were pooled into non-polysomal and polysomal samples according to OD254nm profiles. Non-polysomal and polysomal samples from 3 gradients were pooled together. Following addition of an equal volume of ethanol, pools were precipitated overnight at -20oC. RNA was spun down (10000rpm, 20 mins, 4oC), washed in 2 mL 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 400 μL TE buffer. RNA was re-precipitated by addition of 0.1 volume 3M Sodium acetate pH 5.2 and 2 volumes ethanol, at -20oC for 1 hour. RNA was spun down as before, washed in 1 mL 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 0.5 mL water. Any residual protein was removed by extraction with phenol:chloroform (1:1 v/v) and chloroform:IAA (24:1 v/v).

      <name>Transcription profiling of mouse SMARTA transgenic cells in response to LCMV or Lm-gp61 infection</name>
      <description>Following infection with LCMV, CD4+ SMARTA TCR transgenic cells (specific for the gp61-80 epitope of the LCMV glycoprotein) rapidly expand, become effector cells, and go on to form a long-lived memory population.  Following infection with a recombinant Listeria monocytogenes expressing the LCMV epitope gp61-80, SMARTA cells also expand but display defective effector differentiation and fail to form memory.  In an attempt to understand the signals required for CD4 T cell memory differentiation, we compared gene expression by SMARTA cells at the peak of the primary response following either Lm-gp61 or LCMV infection. Experiment Overall Design: SMARTA cells were purified at day 7 post-infection with either LCMV or Lm-gp61.  SMARTA cells were sorted on the basis of Thy1.1 expression using a FACSAria.  Cells were sorted through the machine twice to enhance purity.  Two biological replicates of each group are provided.  Each replicate represents the results of SMARTA pooled from three animals.</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of human lung adenocarcinoma and non-tumors from former, current and never smoking individuals</name>
      <description>Tobacco smoking is responsible for over 90% of lung cancer cases, and yet the precise molecular alterations induced by smoking in lung that develop into cancer and impact survival have remained obscure.   We performed gene expression analysis using HG-U133A Affymetrix chips on 135 fresh frozen tissue samples of adenocarcinoma and paired noninvolved lung tissue from current, former and never smokers, with biochemically validated smoking information.  ANOVA analysis adjusted for potential confounders, multiple testing procedure, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and GO-functional classification were conducted for gene selection. Results were confirmed in independent adenocarcinoma and non-tumor tissues from two studies.  We identified a gene expression signature characteristic of smoking that includes cell cycle genes, particularly those involved in the mitotic spindle formation (e.g., NEK2, TTK, PRC1). Expression of these genes strongly differentiated both smokers from non-smokers in lung tumors and early stage tumor tissue from non-tumor tissue (p&lt;0.001 and fold-change>1.5, for each comparison), consistent with an important role for this pathway in lung carcinogenesis induced by smoking. These changes persisted many years after smoking cessation. NEK2 (p&lt;0.001) and TTK (p=0.002) expression in the noninvolved lung tissue was also associated with a 3-fold increased risk of mortality from lung adenocarcinoma in smokers.   Our work provides insight into the smoking-related mechanisms of lung neoplasia, and shows that the very mitotic genes known to be involved in cancer development are induced by smoking and affect survival. These genes are candidate targets for chemoprevention and treatment of lung cancer in smokers. Experiment Overall Design: Overall, 180 adenocarcinoma and non-tumor tissue samples were selected for the analyses, including duplicate or triplicate samples from 14 subjects for quality control. From the original 180 samples, 148 provided sufficient quantity of high-quality RNA for microarray analyses; 13 additional samples were excluded because of problematic assays. Normalization was conducted on the remaining 135 microarrays. After normalization, 13 samples were excluded because of low percentage of tumor cells in the tumor tissues. This report is based on 122 samples, of which 15 duplicates were averaged, resulting in 107 final expression values from 58 tumor and 49 non-tumor tissues from 20 never smokers, 26 former smokers, and 28 current smokers.</description>

      <name>Alteration of microRNA gene expression by EBV encoded LMP1 oncogene</name>
      <description>The Epstein Barr virus (EBV) encoded latent membrane protein-1 (LMP1) is a functional homologue of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and contributes substantially to the oncogenic potential of EBV through activation of Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNA molecules that are involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as growth, development, and apoptosis, and have recently been linked to cancer phenotypes. Through miRNA microarray analysis, we demonstrate that LMP1 dysregulates the expression of several cellular miRNAs, including the most highly regulated of these, miR-146a. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed induced expression of miR-146a by LMP1. Analysis of miR-146a expression in EBV latency type III and type I cell lines revealed substantial expression of miR-146a in type III (which express LMP1) but not in type I cell lines. Reporter studies demonstrated that LMP1 induces miR-146a predominantly through two NF-kappaB binding sites in the miR-146a promoter and identified a role for an OCT-1 site in conferring basal and induced expression. Array analysis of cellular mRNAs expressed in Akata cells transduced with an miR-146a expressing retrovirus identified genes that are directly or indirectly regulated by miR-146a, including a group of interferon responsive genes that are inhibited by miR-146a. Since miR-146a is known to be induced by agents that activate the interferon response pathway (including LMP1), these results suggest that miR-146a functions in a negative feedback loop to modulate the intensity and/or duration of the interferon response. Keywords: microRNA expression modified by EBV encoded oncogene, LMP1 EBV negative Mutu E1dn Cl. 3 cells were transduced with either a control retrovirus (pEhyg) or an LMP1 containing retrovirus (pEhyg-FLAG-LMP1).  Cells were selected with hygromycin for approximately 2 weeks afterwhich 5 pairs of RNA preps were carried out on 5 successive days.  Arrays GSM255656 and GSM255659 are dye swaps in which LMP1 samples were labeled with Cy3 and control samples were labeled with Cy5.</description>

      <name>Gene expression response to the antifungal compound sampangine</name>
      <description>Sampangine, a plant-derived alkaloid found in the Annonaceae family, exhibits strong inhibitory activity against the opportunistic fungal pathogens Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus.  In the present study, transcriptional profiling experiments coupled with the analysis of mutants were performed in an effort to elucidate its mechanism of action.  Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, we show that sampangine produces a transcriptional response indicative of hypoxia, altering the expression of genes known to respond to low oxygen conditions.  Several additional lines of evidence obtained suggest that these responses could involve effects on heme.   First, the hem1 deletion mutant lacking the first enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway showed increased sensitivity to sampangine, and exogenously supplied hemin partially rescued the inhibitory activity of sampangine in wild-type cells.  In addition, heterozygous mutants with deletions in genes involved in five out of eight steps in the heme biosynthetic pathway showed increased susceptibility to sampangine.  Furthermore, spectral analysis of pyridine extracts indicated significant accumulation of free porphyrins in sampangine-treated cells.  Transcriptional profiling experiments were also performed in C. albicans to investigate the response of a pathogenic fungal species to sampangine.  Taking into account the known differences in the physiological responses of C. albicans and S. cerevisiae to low oxygen, significant correlations were observed between the two transcription profiles suggestive of heme-related defects.  Our results indicate that the antifungal activity of the plant alkaloid sampangine is due, at least in part, to perturbations in the biosynthesis or metabolism of heme.

      <name>Transcription profiling of human highly metastatic cell lines derived from Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) with specific bone tropism reveals a novel lung cancer gene signature mediates metastatic bone colonization by a dual mechanism</name>
      <description>Bone is a frequent target of lung cancer metastasis, which is associated with significant morbidity and a dismal prognosis. To identify and functionally characterize genes involved in the mechanisms of osseous metastasis we developed a murine lung cancer model. Comparative transcriptomic analysis identified genes encoding signaling molecules (such as TCF4 and PRKD3), and cell anchorage related proteins (MCAM, and SUSD5), some of which were basally modulated by TGFbeta in tumor cells and in conditions mimicking tumor-stroma interactions. Triple gene combinations induced not only high osteoclastogenic activity but also a marked enhancement of global metalloproteolytic activities in vitro. These effects were strongly associated with robust bone colonization in vivo, whereas this gene subset was ineffective in promoting local tumor growth and cell homing activity to bone. Interestingly, global inhibition of metalloproteolytic activities and simultaneous TGFbeta blockade in vivo led to increased survival and a remarkable attenuation of bone tumor burden and osteolytic metastasis. Thus, this metastatic gene signature mediates bone-matrix degradation by a dual mechanism of induction of TGFbeta-dependent osteoclastogenic bone resorption and enhancement of stroma-dependent metalloproteolytic activities. Our findings suggest the cooperative contribution of host-derived and cell-autonomous effects directed by a small subset of genes in mediating aggressive osseous colonization. Experiment Overall Design: Human highly metastatic cell lines derived from Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) with specific bone tropism. Cell lines were selected by induction of prominent bone metastases lesions. The metastatic lines were systematically and accurately discriminate using 3 complementary parameters: survival curves of newly injected mice; computerized image analysis of bone metastatic areas; conspicuous SCCs derived from each animal (10 mice/group). Experiment Overall Design: Genome-wide expression analysis was done using 13 microarrays, corresponding to 4 samples of control non-metastatic cell lines and 9 samples of 3 different highly metastatic cell lines (M1, M4, M5) each with 3 biological replicates. Moreover, in each microarray pools of 3 groups of the corresponding cells were used.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Growth Protocol - The cells were cultured in DMEM containing 20% foetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ng/ml streptomycin. Before passaging, the adherent cells were rinsed with PBS (37°C) three times to remove the fetal bovine serum that inhibits the trypsinization and trypsinized with 5-8 ml of Trypsine/EDTA solution at 37°C in the incubator. Confluent cell cultures (3-6 x 105 cells/cm2) were split, and seeded out for stimulation at 1 x 105 cells/cm2.
 Sample Processing - Cells were stimulated for 60 min with recombinant human TNF-α in a final concentration of 5 ng/ml.
 Hybridization - Prior to each hybridization reaction, unused filters were initially washed in 1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min (X 2) followed by three washes in 0.1 X SSC; 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 80°C. These washes eliminated the potential problem for unbound or loosely bound probe cDNA from interfering with the hybridization reaction. Each cDNA filter was pre-wetted with deionized water and placed in a hybridization bottle (3.5 X 25 cm). The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50°C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL). The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42°C. Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65°C. Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.
 Labeling - 200 - 500 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA sample using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983). Reversed transcribed cDNA were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously (labeling reaction at 42°C for 60 min; Eickhoff et al. 2000). RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68°C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl. Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers protocol, with minor modifications that improved RNA yields and purity in our hands. Cells were lysed in an appropriate volume of Buffer RLT. To facilitate complete lysis, samples were allowed to stand at room temperature for 5-10 min before vortexing. The lysate was homogenized by addition to a QIA shredder column (Qiagen) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 3 min to pellet any cell debris. One volume of 70% ethanol was added to the cleared lysate, added to the RNeasy column and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 sec. Bound RNA was washed with the addition of RW1 buffer to the column and allowed to stand at room temperature for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 sec. DNase 1 incubation mix (Stock: 273 kunits; RNase-free DNase Set, Qiagen) was added directly to the spin column membrane and digestion of any contaminating genomic DNA was carried out at room temperature for 30 min. The column was washed with RWI buffer and the DNase treatment step was repeated. The bound RNA was washed with RW1 buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 sec three times, followed by two additional wash and centrifugation steps with RPE buffer. Finally, purified RNA was eluted off the column with RNase-free water. RNA concentration and purity was determined spectrophotometrically at A260/A280 and was determined to be intact as assessed by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. The presence of genomic DNA contamination was assessed by PCR amplification of GAPDH using standard PCR conditions and the following primers: GAPDH_F2-5’- ACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTGAC-3’, GAPDH_R2- 5’-CTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGT-3’. RNA was re-treated with DNase if necessary. Upon confirming the quality of the RNA (intact and free of genomic DNA), 15 µg of total RNA for expression screening.</field>

 Feature Extraction - The image data files were gridded using AIDA software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) and the results were imported in a custom-made database. The ranked expression data distribution was found to follow Zipf´s law (Hoyle et al, 2002) and the logarithmic normal transformed datasets were normalised following this principle, as previously described by Lu et al. 2005. Any hybridisation signal that had a value that fell below a predefined threshold (mean background + 2x standard deviation) were considered as indistinguishable from background and was set to zero. Those values where duplicate expression values for the same gene were not similar (outliers or false positive, difference between duplicates >20%) were eliminated.
 Image Adquisition - Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan).</field>

The water was completely poured off and the filter was pre-hybridized for 2 hrs at 50°C in a 10 mL of hybridization solution containing 7% SDS, 50% formamide, 5 X SCC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and denatured herring sperm DNA (50microg/microL). The labeled target was added to the filters in 5 mL of the same preheated solution and hybridization of the filters was performed overnight (24 hrs) at 42°C. Following overnight hybridization, membranes were removed from the bottles and washed in 1 X SSC/0.1% SDS buffer for 10 min at room temperature followed by two washes for 30 min in 0.2 X SSC/0.1% SDS at 65°C. Excess moisture was removed by briefly placing the membranes on filter paper (Whatman) and the damp filters were wrapped in commercial grade plastic wrap.
 Labeling - 200 - 500 ng mRNA was isolated from total RNA sample using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Prior to hybridization, 20ng of Arabidopsis thaliana DNA template was labeled with a-33P dCTP (10 microCi/microL; Amersham) during a random priming labeling reaction (pd(N)6, Amersham) (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983). Reversed transcribed cDNA were prepared in a final volume of 30microL as described in detail previously (labeling reaction at 42°C for 60 min; Eickhoff et al. 2000). RNA was hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions by the addition of 3.5 microL of 3M NaOH and incubation for 20 min at 68°C. The samples were neutralized with the addition of 10 microL of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10.5 microL of 1M HCl. Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from both control and patient targets by filtration through Microspin G-50 columns according to the product manual (Amersham).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers protocol, with minor modifications that improved RNA yields and purity in our hands. Cells were lysed in an appropriate volume of Buffer RLT. To facilitate complete lysis, samples were allowed to stand at room temperature for 5-10 min before vortexing. The lysate was homogenized by addition to a QIA shredder column (Qiagen) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 3 min to pellet any cell debris. One volume of 70% ethanol was added to the cleared lysate, added to the RNeasy column and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 sec. Bound RNA was washed with the addition of RW1 buffer to the column and allowed to stand at room temperature for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 sec. DNase 1 incubation mix (Stock: 273 kunits; RNase-free DNase Set, Qiagen) was added directly to the spin column membrane and digestion of any contaminating genomic DNA was carried out at room temperature for 30 min. The column was washed with RWI buffer and the DNase treatment step was repeated. The bound RNA was washed with RW1 buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 sec three times, followed by two additional wash and centrifugation steps with RPE buffer. Finally, purified RNA was eluted off the column with RNase-free water. RNA concentration and purity was determined spectrophotometrically at A260/A280 and was determined to be intact as assessed by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. The presence of genomic DNA contamination was assessed by PCR amplification of GAPDH using standard PCR conditions and the following primers: GAPDH_F2-5’- ACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTGAC-3’, GAPDH_R2- 5’-CTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGT-3’. RNA was re-treated with DNase if necessary. Upon confirming the quality of the RNA (intact and free of genomic DNA), 15 µg of total RNA for expression screening.</field>

 Feature Extraction - The image data files were gridded using AIDA software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) and the results were imported in a custom-made database. The ranked expression data distribution was found to follow Zipf´s law (Hoyle et al, 2002) and the logarithmic normal transformed datasets were normalised following this principle, as previously described by Lu et al. 2005. Any hybridisation signal that had a value that fell below a predefined threshold (mean background + 2x standard deviation) were considered as indistinguishable from background and was set to zero. Those values where duplicate expression values for the same gene were not similar (outliers or false positive, difference between duplicates >20%) were eliminated.
 Image Adquisition - Filters were exposed ~24 hrs to imaging plates (BAS-MS 2325, Fujifilm, Japan) and scanning was carried out at a resolution of 50microns on a FLA-3000G imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan).</field>

      <name>Transcription profiling of Esophageal tumor Samples</name>
      <description>Esophageal cancer is among the 10 most common malignancies and ranks as the 6th leading cause of death from cancer. It constitutes 7% of all gastrointestinal cancers and is one of the most lethal of all cancers. The large variation in the incidence of esophageal cancer in different geographic regions has often been thought to be due to variation in exposure to environmental factors; however, hereditary factors may also contribute to the variation in rates. A positive family history was found to be associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer in several case-control and cohort studies in China. Familial aggregation also has been observed in Iran and Japan. The cancer data generated from six hospital based cancer registries in India under National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP, Annual Report, 2003-2004) has revealed that the occurrence of esophageal cancer in Assam is highest in India. The aggregation of esophageal cancer in families is a long-observed and well-documented phenomenon in Assam of North-east part of India (AAR=32.6). In Assam high incidence of esophageal cancer with familial aggregation need investigation for etiology. The etiology of esophageal cancer in Northeast Indian population is different from other population at India due to wide variations in dietary habits or nutritional factors, tobacco chewing and alcohol habits.  With in these high-risk regions, studies have shown a strong tendency toward familial aggregation, suggesting that genetic susceptibility, in conjunction with potential environmental exposures, may be involved in the etiology of esophageal cancer. Familial clustering of cancer has been one of the main avenues to the understanding of cancer etiology and the signal to the involvement of heritable genes. Familial clustering of cancer may be due to environmental factors shared by family members or due to shared genes. However, the familial aggregation of esophageal cancer among the population in northeast India may reflect the influence of environmental factors operating on individuals who are already genetically susceptible. Epidemiological studies indicate that tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption are the major factors for esophageal cancer, the role  of genetic factors for familial aggregation has not been elucidated. In this study, tumor and matched normal tissue from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients with a family history of upper gastrointestinal cancer were analyzed using cDNA microarray containing 10,000genes to evaluate gene expression differences in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients with a family history of upper gastrointestinal cancer from a high- risk area in India. To identify alteration in genes and molecular functional pathways in esophageal cancer in a high incidence region of India where there is wide spread use of tobacco and betel quid with fermented areca nuts and familial aggregation cancer. Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) was used for labeling. Briefly, both first and second strand cDNA were synthesized by incubating 500ng of total RNA with 1.2ul of oligo dT-T7 Promoter Primer in nuclease-free water at 65 ◦C for 10 min followed by incubation with 4.0ul of 5× First strand buffer, 2ul of 0.1M DTT, 1 ul of 10mM dNTP mix, 1ul of 200 U/ul MMLV-RT, and 0.5ul of 40U/ul RNaseOUT, at 40 ◦C for 2 hour. Immediately following cDNA synthesis, the reaction mixture was incubated with 2.4 ul of 10 mM Cyanine-3-CTP or 2.4 ul of 10 mM Cyanine-5-CTP (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA), 20ul of 4X Transcription buffer, 8 ul of NTP mixture, 6 ul of 0.1M DTT, 0.5 ul of RNaseOUT, 0.6ul of Inorganic pyrophosphatase, 0.8 ul of T7 RNA polymerase, and 15.3ul of nuclease-free water at 40 ◦C for 2 hour. Qiagen’s RNeasy mini spin columns were used for purifying amplified aRNA samples. The quantity and specific activity of cRNA was determined by using NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-VIS Spectrophotometer version3.2.1. Samples with specific activity >8 were used for hybridization. 825ng of each Cyanine 3 or Cyanine 5 labeled cRNA in a volume of 41.8ul were combined with 11ul of 10x Blocking agent and 2.2ul of 25x Fragmentation buffer (Agilent), and incubated at 60deg C for 30 minutes in dark. The fragmented cRNA were mixed with 55ul of 2x Hybridization Buffer (Agilent). About 110ul of the resulting mixture was applied to the Microarray and hybridized at 65degC for 17 hours in an Agilent Microarray Hybridization Chamber (SureHyb: G2534A) with Hybridization Oven. After hybridization, slides were washed with Agilent Gene expression Wash Buffer I for 1 minute at room temperature followed by a 1 min wash with Agilent Gene expression Wash Buffer II for 37C. Slides were finally rinsed with Acetonitrile for cleaning up and drying. Microarrays were scanned on an Agilent scanner (G2565AA) at 100% laser power, 30% PMT.Data extraction was carried out with Agilent Feature Extraction software (version 9.1), and normalization was done using linear per array algorithm according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The data was analysed by GeneSpring GX and Biointerpreter software from Genotypic Technology, Bangalore. The differential expression was considered if the Log 2 mean of at least -1 for the down regulated genes and +1 for the upregulated genes. We considered only the genes that were reproducible from all replicates.</description>

      <name>Mapping translocation breakpoints by next-generation sequencing</name>
      <description>Balanced chromosome rearrangements (BCRs) can cause genetic diseases by disrupting or inactivating specific genes, and the characterisation of breakpoints in disease-associated BCRs has been instrumental in the molecular elucidation of a wide variety of genetic disorders. However, mapping chromosome breakpoints using traditional methods, such as in situ hybridization with fluorescent dye-labeled bacterial artificial chromosome clones (BAC-FISH), is rather laborious and time consuming. In addition, the resolution of BAC-FISH is often insufficient to unequivocally identify the disrupted gene. To overcome these limitations, we have performed shotgun sequencing of flow-sorted derivative chromosomes using ‘next generation’ (Solexa/Illumina) multiplex sequencing-by-synthesis technology. As shown here for three different disease-associated BCRs, the coverage attained by this platform is sufficient to bridge the breakpoints by PCR amplification, and this procedure allows to determine their exact nucleotide positions within few weeks. Its implementation will greatly facilitate large-scale breakpoint mapping and gene finding in patients with disease-associated balanced translocations. Array CGH was performed in three carriers of balanced translocations to exclude DNA copy number changes.</description>

      <name>Systematic evaluation of variability in simulated ChIP-chip experiments</name>
      <description>The most widely used method for detecting genome-wide protein-DNA interactions is chromatin immunoprecipitation on tiling microarrays, commonly known as ChIP-chip. Here, we conducted the first objective analysis of tiling array platforms, amplification procedures, and signal detection algorithms in a simulated ChIP-chip experiment. Mixtures of human genomic DNA and "spike-ins" comprised of nearly 100 human sequences at various concentrations were hybridized to four tiling array platforms by eight independent groups. Blind to the number of spike-ins, their locations, and the range of concentrations, each group made predictions of the spike-in locations. We found that microarray platform choice is not the primary determinant of overall performance. In fact, variation in performance between labs, protocols and algorithms within the same array platform was greater than the variation in performance between array platforms. However, each array platform had unique performance characteristics that varied with tiling resolution and the number of replicates, which have implications for cost versus detection power. Long oligonucleotide arrays were slightly more sensitive at detecting very low enrichment. On all platforms, simple sequence repeats and genome redundancy tended to result in false positives. LM-PCR and WGA, the most popular sample amplification techniques, reproduced relative enrichment levels with high fidelity. Performance among signal detection algorithms was heavily dependent on array platform. The spike-in DNA samples and the data presented here provide a stable benchmark against which future ChIP platforms, protocol improvements, and analysis methods can be evaluated.

      <name>Culture of Campylobacter jejuni with Sodium Deoxycholate induces Virulence Gene Expression</name>
      <description>C. jejuni, a spiral-shaped gram-negative bacterium, is a leading bacterial cause of human foodborne illness.  Acute disease is associated with C. jejuni invasion of the intestinal epithelium.  Further, maximal host cell invasion requires the secretion of proteins termed Campylobacter invasion antigens (Cia).  As bile acids are known to alter the pathogenic behavior of other gastrointestinal pathogens, we hypothesized that the virulence potential of Campylobacter may be triggered by the bile acid deoxycholate (DOC).  In support of this hypothesis, culturing C. jejuni with a physiologically relevant concentration of DOC significantly altered the kinetics of cell invasion as evidenced by gentamicin-protection assays.  In contrast to C. jejuni harvested from Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar plates, C. jejuni harvested from MH agar plates supplemented with DOC demonstrated Cia secretion as judged by metabolic labeling experiments.  DOC was also found to induce the expression of the ciaB gene as judged by B-galactosidase reporter assays and real-time RT-PCR.  Microarray analysis revealed that DOC induced the expression of virulence genes (i.e., ciaB, cmeABC, dccR, and tlyA).  In summary, we demonstrate that it is possible to enhance the pathogenic behavior of C. jejuni by modifying the culture conditions.  These results provide a foundation to identify genes expressed by C. jejuni in response to in vivo-like culture conditions. Keywords: Stress response For the expression profiling arrays, an indirect comparison of gene expression was performed, where the expression profile of the C. jejuni F38011 cultured in the presence and absence of DOC was measured separately on different slides as described previously (26).  Briefly, Cy5 labeled reference DNA from the C. jejuni F38011 strain was mixed with Cy3 labeled test cDNA (C. jejuni F38011 cultured in the presence or absence of DOC) and hybridized to the Campylobacter cDNA array (26) on separate slides.  DNA microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B microarray laser scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and the data for spot and background intensities were processed using the GenePix 4.0 software. To compensate for any effect of the amount of template and uneven Cy-dye incorporation, data normalization was performed as previously described (26). For the comparison of genes differentially expressed in the presence and absence of DOC,six hybridization measurements were generated per biological experiment (three technical replicate arrays and two replicate features per array).</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Hybridization - We combined and precipitated 50 ml Cy3 labeled test DNA, 50 ml Cy5 labeled reference DNA and 100 mg human Cot-1 DNA by adding 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ice-cold ethanol. We collected the precipitate by centrifugation and dissolved the pellet in a final hybridization mixture containing 50% formamide, 2xSSC and 4% SDS. We denatured the hybridization mixture at 75°C for 10-15 min and then incubated the samples at 37°C for 1 hour to block repetitive DNA sequences. We applied a ring of rubber cement closely around the array to form a well, into which we added 50 ml of a pre-incubation solution containing 250 mg salmon sperm DNA, 50% formamide, 2xSSC and 4% SDS.  After a 30 min incubation at room temperature, we removed ~30 ml of the pre-incubation solution and added the denatured and re-annealed hybridization mixture.  We placed a silicone gasket around each hybridization area, placed a microscope slide on top of the gasket, which was thick enough to prevent the microscope slide from contacting the hybridization solution and clamped the whole unit together using binder clips to create an air tight environment.  We carried out the hybridization to the arrays for ~48 hrs on a slowly rocking table at 37°C.  After disassembling the hybridization chamber, we rinsed off the excess hybridization fluid with PN buffer (PN: 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.1% nonidet P40, pH 8), then washed the arrays once in a solution containing 50% formamide in 2xSSC for 15 min. at 45°C and finally in PN buffer at room temperature for 15 min.  Subsequently, we removed the ring of rubber cement, drained excess liquid from the arrays, mounted them in a solution containing 90% glycerol, 10% PBS and 1 mM DAPI, and sealed them with a cover slip.
 Labeling - We labeled genomic DNA by random priming in a 50 ml reaction by combining 300 ng genomic DNA, 1x random primers solution (BioPrime DNA Labeling System, Gibco BRL), 1x dNTP solution (0.2 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, 0.05 mM dCTP, 1 mM Tris base (pH 7.6), 0.1 mM EDTA), 40 mM Cy3 or Cy5-dCTP (Amersham) and 40 U Klenow fragment (BioPrime DNA Labeling System, Gibco BRL).  We incubated the DNA and the random primers in a volume of 42 ml at 100°C for 10-15 min, placed the reaction on ice and added the dNTP solution, labeled nucleotides and Klenow fragment. We incubated the random priming reaction overnight at 37°C. We removed unincorporated nucleotides using a Sephadex spin-column.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - We incubated cells from a T75 flask overnight at 55°C in a 3 ml solution containing 0.01 M Tris, pH 7.5, 0.001 M EDTA, pH 8, 0.5% SDS and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K. We precipitated the DNA with ethanol, recovered it by spooling and then dissolved it in ~300 ml H2O.</field>

      <name>Transcription profiling of human chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples to improve prognosis and predict therapeutic response</name>
      <description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous malignancy, characterized by a variable clinical course. While clinical and laboratory parameters are increasingly being used to refine prognosis, they do not accurately predict response to commonly used therapy.  We used gene expression profiling to generate and further refine prognostic and predictive markers.  Genomic signatures that reflect progressive disease and responses to chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy were created using cancer cell lines and patient leukemia samples.  We validated these signatures using independent clinical data from four separate cohorts representing a total of 301 CLL patients.  A prognostic genomic signature created from patient leukemic cell gene expression data coupled with clinical parameters could statistically differentiate patients with stable or progressive disease in the training dataset.  The progression signature was then validated in two independent datasets, demonstrating a capacity to accurately identify patients at risk for progressive disease.  In addition, two distinct genomic signatures that predict response to chlorambucil or pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab were also generated and were shown to accurately distinguish responding and non-responding CLL patients.  Microarray analysis of CLL patients’ lymphocytes can be used to refine prognosis and predict response to different therapies.  These results have direct implications for standard and investigational therapeutics in CLL patients. Experiment Overall Design: For the predictive genomic signature or response to pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, 20 CLL leukemia samples were used in the training set, and 20 CLL leukemia samples were used in the validation set</description>

      <name>Spironolactone effect on renal RNA expression in 36 wk old NZB/W F1 female mice</name>
      <description>The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of aldosterone receptor blockade on the immunopathogenesis and progression of nephritis in the (NZBxNZW) F1 murine lupus model. Female NZB/W F1 mice (11 weeks old) were treated daily with 25 or 50 mg/kg of oral spironolactone or vehicle. Proteinuria, renal function and serum autoantibody levels were monitored. Renal histopathology, immune complex deposition, and immunohistochemistry were analyzed at various time points. Targeted microarray analysis was performed on renal tissue, with subsequent real time PCR analysis of several differentially expressed genes.  At 36 weeks of age,  8 mice from each treatment group (vehicle, 25 mg/kg/d spironolactone and 50 mg/kg/d spironolactone) were anesthetized and perfused with cold saline; then one kidney per mouse was removed , homogenized in Tripure, and frozen at -80 until RNA extraction. RNA was extracted using Tripure and a Qiagen RNEasy Minikit. RNA was pooled equally by weight within each treatment group and frozen at -80. Subsequently, the three batches of pooled RNA were processed for microarray analysis.</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of human chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples from patients with stable or progressive disease</name>
      <description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous malignancy, characterized by a variable clinical course. While clinical and laboratory parameters are increasingly being used to refine prognosis, they do not accurately predict response to commonly used therapy.  We used gene expression profiling to generate and further refine prognostic and predictive markers.  Genomic signatures that reflect progressive disease and responses to chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy were created using cancer cell lines and patient leukemia samples.  We validated these signatures using independent clinical data from four separate cohorts representing a total of 301 CLL patients.  A prognostic genomic signature created from patient leukemic cell gene expression data coupled with clinical parameters could statistically differentiate patients with stable or progressive disease in the training dataset.  The progression signature was then validated in two independent datasets, demonstrating a capacity to accurately identify patients at risk for progressive disease.  In addition, two distinct genomic signatures that predict response to chlorambucil or pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab were also generated and were shown to accurately distinguish responding and non-responding CLL patients.  Microarray analysis of CLL patients’ lymphocytes can be used to refine prognosis and predict response to different therapies.  These results have direct implications for standard and investigational therapeutics in CLL patients. Experiment Overall Design: For the prognostic genomic signature, 68 CLL leukemia samples were used (36 from patients with stable disease and 32 from patients with progressive disease).</description>

      <description>We used high-throughput methods to discover the Salmonella RNAs that are targeted by the bacterial Sm-like protein, Hfq. Our generic approach, using chromosomal epitope tagging and coIP-on-chip will also be useful to identify the post-transcriptional regulons of many other RNA-binding proteins.  Keywords: coIP-chip To identify the direct Hfq RNA targets, we co-immunoprecipitated RNA from a strain expressing a 3xFLAG-tagged Hfq-protein using an anti-3xFLAG antibody. As a negative control, we used the same antibody (anti-3xFLAG) to co-immunoprecipitate RNA from an isogenic strain expressing the non-tagged Hfq-protein. Two independent biological replicates were generated.</description>

 Hybridization - Labelled samples were resuspended in hybridization buffer (1 M NaCl; 50 mM Mes, pH 7.0; 20% formamide; 1% Triton X-100). The hybridization was performed in microarray chambers (Agilent Technologies) and rotated at 55° over 48 h. The arrays were then washed with Wash 1 [6× standard saline phosphate/EDTA (0.18 M NaCl/10 mM phosphate, pH 7.4/1 mM EDTA] (SSPE)/0.005% N-lauryl sarcosine] and Wash 2 (0.06% SSPE/0.18% polyethylene glycol 200), both for 5 min at room temperature.
 Labeling - 100-200 ng immunoprecipitated RNA was reverse transcribed into ssDNA by random priming using 200 U of AffinityScript (Stratagene) at 50°C. RNA was subsequently hydrolysed by adding 0.1N NaOH and incubating the sample for 10min at 70°. The alkali was neutralised adding 0.1N HCl. As all the nucleotide probes present on the microarrays used (Platform GPL5791) correspond to the ‘+’-strand, prior to the incorporation of the fluorescent label we converted ssDNA to dsDNA using random priming and the klenow fragment from the BioPrime DNA labelling system (Invitrogen). Cy-dye incorporation into cDNA was performed using the 'Direct labelling of DNA' protocol that can be found at http://www.ifr.bbsrc.ac.uk/safety/microarrays/protocols.html. All clean up steps were performed by ethanol precipitation rather than by using spin columns to avoid loosing the shorter RNA/cDNA species.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Strains were grown in L-broth under normal aeration at 37°C up to ESP (OD600 = 2.0). Coimmunoprecipitated RNA was isolated following the protocol described in: Pfeiffer et al. (2007); Molecular microbiology 66, 1174-1191.</field>

 Feature Extraction - Image analysis was performed using the BlueFuse software (BlueGnome). Block-median data centring was then performed in BlueFuse to obtain a median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 25 blocks equal to 1. This step generated the AMPCH1 and AMPCH2 values. When comparing AMPCH1 and AMPCH2 values from different hybridisations, we observed slight deviations which were dependent on gene expression levels. These were corrected using the Loess function in R (Limma package), thus generating values found in the VALUE column.

      <name>Gene expression analysis of in vitro cultured tomato plantlets</name>
      <description>Plants growth and development is highly dependent on the environment. During there lifespan, plants are submitted to changing environmental conditions that requires constant metabolic adjustments. In particular, in vitro cultured plantlets are exposed, throughout micropropagation, to unique growth conditions characterized by distinctive levels of nitrogen, exogenous sugar, light and atmospheric conditions. To resume growth upon transfer ex vitro, in vitro plantlets must acclimatize to natural conditions. In this study, the impact of the in vitro environment on the expression profile of tomato (Solanum Lycopersicum) plantlets was analysed using the microarray and real-time PCR methods. After 20 days of growth in vitro, a significant increase in expression of genes linked to photosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism and salicylic acid signaling pathways was observed. By opposition, the expression of transcripts associated to carbohydrate metabolism and jasmonic acid signaling pathway were reduced. Also, the expression of reactive oxygen scavenging (ROS) enzymes in the mitochondrias, chloroplasts and cytosol were altered in in vitro cultured tomato plantlets. More precisely, the in vitro environment led to increased photosynthetic gene expression, lower sink strength, up-regulation of nitrogen assimilation and induced a specific stress response in tomato plantlets. Our results suggest that the presence of exogenous sugar is an important environmental cue that governs the modified cell ROS pattern, defense-related genes modulation and abnormal physiology of in vitro plantlets.  Keywords: environmental challenge, growth condition comparison, expression profile Three biological replicates consisting of three individual plantlets grown in different vessels (in vitro) or pots (ex vitro) were used for the competitive hybridization. To reduce possible bias due to the difference in the properties of both dyes, two technical replicates consisting of dye swap were realized. The complete experiment required six microarrays.</description>

        <field name="sample_protocol">Sample Processing - For the experiment, plantlets were grown in vitro in stacked doubled magenta vessel (Sigma, Oakville, ON, Canada). Each vessel contained a single plantlet. Axillary apex of single node cuttings were grown for 20 days on MS medium containing 8% bacto-agar (BD Diagnostic System, Sparks, MD, USA), and 3% sucrose. In the growth room, plantlets were submitted to a 16-h photoperiod at 60 μmol photons m-2 s-1 and 23/20°C day/night temperature. After 20 days, the plantlets second leaf was harvested.
 Hybridization - SlideHyb buffer #1 (Applied Biosystems) was preheated to 68ºC for 30 minutes. Labelled cDNA was resuspended in 4 μl 10 mM EDTA and heat denatured at 95ºC for 10 min. SlideHyb buffer #1 was added to the labelled cDNA. Hybridization was performed by using a SlideBooster from Advalytix AG (Brunnthal, Germany). For this purpose, a lifterSlip (Erie Scientific Company, Partsmouth, NH) was laid down on the array and the hybridization solution injected. After 17-h of hybridization at 55ºC, slides were washed in a low and high stringency buffer as mentioned in the SlideHyb buffer #1 protocol.
 Labeling - cDNA was produced by reverse transcription of 40 μg of total RNA using the Superscript III (Invitrogen). Aminoallyl-dUTP (Applied Biosystems, Streetsville, ON, Canada) were added to the cDNA synthesis reaction to make possible further indirect labelling. The RNA of the hybrid cDNA-RNA was hydrolysed by addition of NaOH 1M and 15 min heating at 65ºC. Reaction was neutralized by adding HCL 1M. A purification step was realized using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Sample where labelled using AlexaFluor 647 reactive dye packs (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer. Briefly, 1 μg of cDNA from each sample were evaporated with Savant speedvac concentrator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), resuspended in 5 μl double-distilled water and 3 μl labelling buffer. DMSO (2 μl) was added to each single-use fluorophore vial and vortexed. Sample cDNA was added to AlexaFluor 647 reactive dye vial. Labelling was performed for a three hour period. Following a purification step, 600 ng of labelled cDNA of each probes were speedvac-evaporated.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - The second leaves from tomato plantlets grown under in vitro culture conditions were harvested after 20 days in vitro. Tissue were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80˚C for further grinding. Total RNA was isolated using Plant RNA Reagent following manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada). RNA concentration was measured using a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE). Possible contamination was access with the 260/280nm ratio. RNA quality was visualized with a 1.5% denatured agarose gels.</field>

 Feature Extraction - Data image were transferred to the Array-Pro Analyzer v.4.5 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA) to detect the intensity of each spot on the array and for background subtraction using the local ring method. Net intensity data were log2 transformed. Data were normalized using the global Loess method included in the Microarray Analysis of Variance (MAANOVA) software. Normalization was performed in order to consider possible intensity-dependent variations in dye bias. Statistical analysis was accomplished by using the F-test of the R/maanova package (Wu et al., 2002), which work under the R programming environment. The false discovery rate (FDR) procedure was applied to the p-values in order to minimize the number of false positives associated to multiple testing. Differentially expressed genes were selected according to the adjusted p-values. Only genes showing an adjusted p-value under 0.01 were kept for further analysis. In addition, the fold change in expression between the two treatments had to be higher than 1.5 to be considered.
 Image Adquisition - Slides were scanned using a VersArray ChipReader (BioRad, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Digital image were acquired with the ChipReader 3.1 software (Bio-Rad).</field>

      <name>Gene Expression in Fixed Tissues and Outcome in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (Training Set, Liver)</name>
      <description>Background: It is a challenge to identify those patients who, after undergoing potentially curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma, are at greatest risk of recurrence. Such high-risk patients could receive novel interventional measures. An obstacle to the development of genome-based predictors of outcome in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma has been the lack of a means to carry out genomewide expression profiling of fixed, as opposed to frozen, tissues. Methods: We aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of gene-expression profiling of more than 6000 human genes in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. We applied the method to tissues from 307 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, from four series of patients, to discover and validate a gene-expression signature associated with survival. Results: The expression-profiling method for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was highly effective: samples from 90% of the patients yielded data of high quality, including samples that had been archived for more than 24 years. Gene-expression profiles of tumor tissue failed to yield a significant association with survival. In contrast, profiles of the surrounding nontumoral liver tissue were highly correlated with survival in a training set of 82 Japanese patients, and the signature was validated in tissues from an independent group of 225 patients from the United States and Europe (p = 0.04). Conclusions: We have demonstrated the feasibility of genomewide expression profiling of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues and have shown that a reproducible gene-expression signature correlating with survival is present in liver tissue adjacent to the tumor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Keywords: Hepatocellular carcinoma, Expression array, Illumina, Signatures, Outcome prediction Training cohort: 80 tumor and 82 non-tumor liver tissues surgically resected from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); Validation cohort: 225 non-tumor liver tissues surgically resected from patients with HCC.

      <name>Transcription profiling of Escherichia coli treated with cefsulodin and mecillinam, alone at the minimum inhibitory concentration</name>
      <description>Gram-negative bacteria possess stress responses to maintain the integrity of the cell envelope.  Stress sensors monitor outer membrane permeability, envelope protein folding, and energization of the inner membrane.  The systems used by Gram-negative bacteria to sense and combat stress resulting from disruption of the peptidoglycan layer are not well characterized.  The peptidoglycan layer is a single molecule that completely surrounds the cell and ensures its structural integrity.  During cell growth new peptidoglcyan subunits are incorporated into the peptidoglycan layer by a series of enzymes called the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).  To explore how Gram-negative bacteria respond to peptidoglycan stress, global gene expression analysis was used to identify Escherichia coli stress responses activated following inhibition of specific PBPs by the β-lactam antibiotics mecillinam and cefsulodin.  Inhibition of PBPs with different roles in peptidoglycan synthesis has different consequences for cell morphology and viability, suggesting that not all perturbations to the peptidoglycan layer generate equivalent stresses.  We demonstrate that inhibition of different PBPs resulted in both shared and unique stress responses.  The regulation of capsular synthesis (Rcs) phosphorelay was activated by inhibition of all of the PBPs tested.  Furthermore, we show that activation of the Rcs phosphorelay increased survival in the presence of these antibiotics, independently of capsule synthesis.  Both activation of the phosphorelay and survival required signal transduction via the outer membrane lipoprotein RcsF and the response regulator RcsB.  We propose that the Rcs pathway responds to peptidoglycan damage and contributes to the intrinsic resistance of E. coli to β-lactam antibiotics. We used microarrays to identify changes in gene expression resulting from treatment of Escherichia coli with the β-lactam antibiotics cefsulodin, mecillinam, or the combination. Experiment Overall Design: E. coli was treated with two b-lactam antibiotics, cefsulodin and mecillinam, alone at the minimum inhibitory concentration to identify the expression changes in response to antibiotic-induced peptidoglycan stress.  E. coli was grown to an OD of 0.2 at which time cefsulodin or mecillinam was added.  Samples of the bacteria were collected at 5 and 10 minutes after treatment with cefsulodin and 60 minutes after treatment with mecillinam.  Untreated cells were also collected at the same time points as controls.  Three biological replicates were collected for all time points and samples, however, only one of the 5 minute untreated samples was hybridized to the arrays.  In addition, a single sample from cells treated with the combination of cefsulodin and mecillinam was hybridized to allow for comparison with samples hybridized to Affymetrix antisense genechips.</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of mouse Clcn5 knockout in proximal tubules of the kidney</name>
      <description>Dent disease has multiple defects attributed to proximal tubule malfunction including low molecular weight proteinuria, aminoaciduria, phosphaturia and glycosuria. In order to understand the changes in kidney function of the Clc5 transporter gene knockout mouse model of Dent disease, we examined gene expression profiles from proximal tubules of mouse kidneys. Overall 720 genes are expressed differentially in the proximal tubules of the Dent Clcn5 knockout mouse model compared to those of control wild type mice. The fingerprint of these gene changes may help us to understand the phenotype of Dent disease. Experiment Overall Design: Renal proximal tubules were dissected from wild type and Clcn5 knockout mice. Mice were anesthetized with halothane, the abdominal aorta of each animal was accessed and the left kidney was perfused with an ice-cold salt.  Proximal tubule dissection was performed in an ice-cold salt solution. After dissection of approximately 80-100 segments of 2 mm in length per kidney, the RNA for 3-4 mice was combined to have enough RNA per chip. Experiment Overall Design: 3 microarrays each of wild type and knockout mouse proximal tubule were processed</description>

      <name>Altered gene expression in zebrafish embryos exposed to tert-butylhydroquinone and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin</name>
      <description>Oxidative stress is an important mechanism of chemical toxicity, contributing to teratogenesis as well as to cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Developing animals may be especially sensitive to chemicals causing oxidative stress. To assess the response to chemicals at different stages of development, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) were exposed to 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 2 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), or 10 uM tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) for 6 hr.  Transcript abundance was assessed by real-time qRT-PCR and microarray (Agilent 22k). By microarray, 1477 probes were significantly different among the DMSO-, tBHQ-, and TCDD-treated embryos at 4 dpf. Of these, 220 were 2-fold or greater up-regulated and 108 were 2-fold or greater down-regulated by tBHQ.  For TCDD, 17 probes were 2-fold or greater up-regulated and 6 were 2-fold or greater down-regulated. Genes induced by tBHQ, included genes involved in glutathione synthesis and utilization, signal transduction, and DNA damage / stress response. Keywords: Danio rerio, TCDD, tBHQ, oxidative stress, gene expression Separate groups of 30 embryos generated from TL adults were placed in 15 ml egg water in a 10-cm glass petri and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6-dpf were exposed for 6 hr to 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 2 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), or 10 uM tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) (4 replicates per compound per time point). Embyros were frozen immediately after the 6 hr exposure and RNA isolated for microarray analysis. A Universal RNA Reference Sample was created by mixing equal amounts of total RNA from 2 replicates each from all toxicants (TCDD, tBHQ, DMSO) and timepoints (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-dpf).  Based on qRT-PCR results, the 4 dpf timepoint was selected for microarray analysis, in which the RNA samples (4 replicates per compound) were Cy3 labeled and co-hybridized with Cy5 labeled Universal RNA Reference Sample to generate data for analysis of variance.</description>

      <name>Maintenance of Long-Range DNA Interactions after Inhibition of Ongoing RNA Polymerase II Transcription.</name>
      <description>A relationship exists between nuclear architecture and gene activity and it has been proposed that the activity of ongoing RNA polymerase II transcription determines genome organization in the mammalian cell nucleus. Recently developed 3C and 4C technology allowed us to test the importance of transcription for nuclear architecture. We demonstrate that upon transcription inhibition binding of RNA polymerase II to gene regulatory elements is severely reduced. However, contacts between regulatory DNA elements and genes in the β-globin locus are unaffected and the locus still interacts with the same genomic regions elsewhere on the chromosome. This is a general phenomenon since the great majority of intra- and interchromosomal interactions with the ubiquitously expressed Rad23a gene are also not affected. Our data demonstrate that without transcription the organization and modification of nucleosomes at active loci and the local binding of specific trans-acting factors is unaltered. We propose that these parameters, more than transcription or RNA polymerase II binding, determine the maintenance of long-range DNA interactions.  Keywords: transcription inhibition 4C 4C experiments were performed in duplo, dye swap was included. Hybridisation was performed on dedicated micro-arrays. Probes (60-mers) were selected from the sequences 100 bp up –and downstream of HindIII sites. To prevent cross-hybridization, probes that had any similarity with highly abundant repeats (RepBase 10.09) were removed from the probeset. In addition, probes that gave more than two BLAST hits in the genome were also removed from the probeset. Sequence alignments were performed using MegaBLAST using the standard settings. A hit was defined as an alignment of 30 nt or longer.</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of Escherichia coli treated with cefsulodin and mecillinam, alone and in combination</name>
      <description>Gram-negative bacteria possess stress responses to maintain the integrity of the cell envelope.  Stress sensors monitor outer membrane permeability, envelope protein folding, and energization of the inner membrane.  The systems used by Gram-negative bacteria to sense and combat stress resulting from disruption of the peptidoglycan layer are not well characterized.  The peptidoglycan layer is a single molecule that completely surrounds the cell and ensures its structural integrity.  During cell growth new peptidoglcyan subunits are incorporated into the peptidoglycan layer by a series of enzymes called the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).  To explore how Gram-negative bacteria respond to peptidoglycan stress, global gene expression analysis was used to identify Escherichia coli stress responses activated following inhibition of specific PBPs by the β-lactam antibiotics mecillinam and cefsulodin.  Inhibition of PBPs with different roles in peptidoglycan synthesis has different consequences for cell morphology and viability, suggesting that not all perturbations to the peptidoglycan layer generate equivalent stresses.  We demonstrate that inhibition of different PBPs resulted in both shared and unique stress responses.  The regulation of capsular synthesis (Rcs) phosphorelay was activated by inhibition of all of the PBPs tested.  Furthermore, we show that activation of the Rcs phosphorelay increased survival in the presence of these antibiotics, independently of capsule synthesis.  Both activation of the phosphorelay and survival required signal transduction via the outer membrane lipoprotein RcsF and the response regulator RcsB.  We propose that the Rcs pathway responds to peptidoglycan damage and contributes to the intrinsic resistance of E. coli to β-lactam antibiotics. We used microarrays to identify changes in gene expression resulting from treatment of Escherichia coli with the β-lactam antibiotics cefsulodin, mecillinam, or the combination. Experiment Overall Design: E. coli was treated with two b-lactam antibiotics, cefsulodin and mecillinam, alone and in combination to identify the expression changes in response to antibiotic-induced peptidoglycan stress.  E. coli was grown to an OD of 0.2 at which time low concentrations of cefsulodin and mecillinam were added individually or in combination.  Samples of the bacteria were collected 5 minutes before treatment as well as 5, 20 and 40 minutes after treatment.  Untreated cells were also collected at the same time points to serve as controls.  At least three biological replicates were collected for all time points and samples, however, only the replicates for the 40 minute time points and the combination time points were hybridized to the arrays as no changes observed for the individual treatments, even at the 40 minute time point.</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of mouse heart implicatesosteoglycin (Ogn) in the regulation of left ventricular mass</name>
      <description>Left ventricular mass (LVM) and cardiac gene expression are complex traits regulated by factors both intrinsic and extrinsic to the heart. To dissect the major determinants of LVM, we combined expression quantitative trait locus1 and quantitative trait transcript (QTT) analyses of the cardiac transcriptome in the rat. Using these methods and in vitro functional assays, we identified osteoglycin (Ogn) as a major candidate regulator of rat LVM, with increased Ogn protein expression associated with elevated LVM. We also applied genome-wide QTT analysis to the human heart and observed that, out of 22,000 transcripts, OGN transcript abundance had the highest correlation with LVM. We further confirmed a role for Ogn in the in vivo regulation of LVM in Ogn knockout mice. Taken together, these data implicate Ogn as a key regulator of LVM in rats, mice and humans, and suggest that Ogn modifies the hypertrophic response to extrinsic factors such as hypertension and aortic stenosis.

      <name>Evolution of virulence control by the staphylococcal agr quorum-sensing regulator</name>
      <description>The Staphylococcus aureus accessory gene regulator (agr) is a prototype quorum-sensing system in Gram-positive bacteria and a paradigmatic example of gene regulation by a small regulatory RNA, RNAIII. Using genome-wide transcriptional profiling in the community-associated methicillin-resistant (CA-MRSA) strain MW2, we demonstrate here that in contrast to the current model of target gene regulation by agr, a large subset of agr-regulated genes is controlled independently of RNAIII. This group comprised predominantly metabolism genes, whereas virulence factors were mostly controlled by RNAIII. Remarkably, the phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) leukocidin genes were the only virulence determinants under RNAIII-independent control, emphasizing their exceptional role in S. aureus physiology and pathogenesis. Of note, PSM promoters bound the AgrA response regulator protein, previously believed to interact exclusively with agr promoters, explaining the exceptionally strict control of PSMs by agr. Our results suggest that virulence factor control is a secondary acquisition of the agr regulon, which evolved by development of RNAIII around the mRNA of the PSM d-toxin, exemplifying how gene control via a small regulatory RNA may be linked to a pre-established regulatory circuit. In addition to elucidating agr control in CA-MRSA, which revealed features potentially crucial for CA-MRSA pathogenesis, our study establishes a novel two-level model of cell-density dependent gene regulation in S. aureus and gives important insight into the connection of metabolism and virulence control in this leading opportunistic pathogen.

      <name>Trans. Profiling of Immortalized Melanocyte Cell Lines Identifies GPNMB as a Melanoblast-Expressed, MITF-Dependent Gene</name>
      <description>Gene expression profiling of tissues derived from different genetic backgrounds can provide insight to potential phenotype-related changes in gene expression.  We have compared wildtype C57BL/6 (melan-Ink4a) melanocyte cell gene expression to that of, “brown“ Tyrp1b/ b (melan-Ink4a-b) and “chocolate” Rab38 cht/cht (melan-cht) melanocyte derived lines. We observed alterations in gene expression consistent with a physiological response of melan-Ink4a-b cells to endoplasmic reticulum protein-folding impairment. Additionally, a set of loci was identified that are expressed in a similar manner to known melanocyte genes. Importantly, the collection of 254 genes is enriched for expression in the multiple melanocyte lines relative to control cell populations. This set contains Tyr, Tyrp1, Dct, Si, Melna, Slc24a5, Slc45a2, Slc24a4, Mitf, and Sox10, in addition to genes not previously attributed to pigmentation and genes with unknown function. Further evaluation of one gene in this cohort, Gpnmb, demonstrated an expression pattern similar to Dct, Si and Mitf. This expression is vastly reduced in MitfMi mutants embryos, indicating that it is dependent on Mitf for in vivo expression. Consistent with this notion, a highly-conserved MITF binding site resides directly upstream of human GPNMB, and deletion of this sequence dramatically reduces in vitro enhancer activity. Keywords: NIH embryo fibroblast cell line, melanocyte cell line, Ink4a, Tyrp1b, Rab38 A 32k expression arrays were generated by printing Oligo nucleotides from Operon Mouse oligo set (MV3) onto epoxy slides. Total RNA from immortalized melanocyte cell lines derived from C57BL/6J Ink4a-/- (melan-Ink4a-1), C57BL/6J Ink4a-/-; Tyrp1b/b (melan-Ink4a-b) and 2 separate C57BL/6J Ink4a-/-; RaB38cht/cht lines (melan-cht4),  (melan-cht5) and NIH3T3 were labeled with Cy5/3 and co-hybridized with a total RNA universal reference (Stratagene, Inc) labeled with Cy3/5. Each comparison was done in Triplicate including one dye swap.</description>

      <name>Microarray analysis of gene expression in acaricide exposed Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus.</name>
      <description>A R. microplus microarray was used to study differential gene expression in acaricide exposed larvae from an amitraz-resistant strain.  The acaricide treatments were: organophosphate (OP), pyrethroid, ivermectin, and amitraz.  The microarrays contained over 13,000 probes corresponding to each member of R. microplus gene index ESTs previously described (http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl?gudb=b_microplus).  Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) data from the OP treated R. microplus was used to verify the OP microarray data.  The expression profiles of selected transcripts were verified by real time PCR.  Among the significantly differentially expressed genes, were a tick legumain, involved in blood digestion, gluthathione S-transferase (GST), a detoxification enzyme involved in pesticide resistance, acyltransferase, several putative salivary sulfotransferases, and a glutamate receptor. **Note: contact person:  Felix D.

        <field name="sample_protocol">Hybridization - Hybridizations done at NimbleGen Inc.  Five R. microplus pooled RNA samples were hybridized to the microarrays.  A control and four different acaricides: organophosphate, pyrethroid, ivermectin, and amitraz.  The hybridization was done twice, resulting in a total of ten array hybridizations, i.e. two technical replicates per treatment including control were used.  The oligonucleotide arrays were used to examine differential gene expression between the control and each acaricide.
 Labeling - Dye: CY3 single channel
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA was isolated from 0.1 g larval material, respectively, using two consecutive 40 sec runs in the FastPrep-24 Tissue and Cell Homogenizer and Lysing Matrix D (Qbiogene, Irvine, CA). A setting of 6.0 with a 3 min ice incubation between runs was used, followed by RNA isolation with the Fast RNA Pro Green Kit (Qbiogene) and subsequent lithium chloride precipitation using the Totally RNA Kit reagents (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX).  Approximately 50 mg total RNA was treated with Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion Inc.) in two 100 ml aliquots each treated with 2 ml of Turbo DNAse per kit protocols.  RNA integrity was verified by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and staining in GelStar Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Cambrex Bio Science, Rockland, ME).  Twenty mg of each DNA-free RNA was sent to NimbleGen for use in microarray analysis.</field>
        <field name="data_protocol">Assay Data Transformation - ID_REF = &lt;br>VALUE = Log2 Normalized signal intensity
 Feature Extraction - The intensity raw values were normalized using quantile normalization to adjust intensity values which arise from variation in the technology rather than from biological differences between the RNA samples. It is important to remove as much of the non-biological variation in signal intensity as possible.  One robust way is by using a ‘complete data method’ of normalization.  The method is called ‘complete data method’ because it makes use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation.  Quantile normalization is a complete data method and this is what was implemented for our dataset.  The goal of this type of normalization is to equalize the distribution of probe intensities for each array in a set of arrays.   (Bolstad, 2001)   Gene Calls: The gene calls were generated using the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) algorithm.  (Irizarray,et al., 2003A,  Irizarray, et al., 2003B,  Bolstad, 2003)   The software package tools used for normalization and gene calling are available through Bioconductor project at:  www.bioconductor.org

 Hybridization - Affymetrix Generic Hybridization
 Labeling - The Ovation™ Biotin RNA Amplification and Labeling System (NuGen Technologies, Inc., San Carlos, CA) was used to prepare amplified, biotin-labeled cDNA from total RNA for following manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, first strand cDNA was synthesized from 25 ng of total RNA using a unique first strand DNA/RNA chimeric primer and reverse transcriptase. Following double strand cDNA generation, amplification of cDNA was achieved by utilizing an isothermal DNA amplification process that involves repeated SPIA™ DNA/RNA primer binding, DNA duplication, strand displacement and RNA cleavage. The amplified SPIA™ cDNA was purified and subjected to a two-step fragmentation and labeling process. The fragmented/biotinylated cDNA content was measured in a ND-1000 spectrophotometer and the quality was analyzed on an RNA 6000 Nano LabChip (Agilent) using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100.
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Total RNA extration was performed by using Absolutely RNA Miniprep Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.

We devised an approach for inducible tethering of genes to the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and demonstrate with 3D DNA-ImmunoFISH, repositioning of chromosomal regions to the nuclear lamina. Relocalization requires mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown and reformation. Tethering leads to the accumulation of lamin and INM proteins but not to association with pericentromeric heterochromatin or nuclear pore complexes. Recruitment of genes to the INM can result in their transcriptional repression. Using DamID we show that as is the case for our model system, inactive Ig loci at the nuclear periphery are contacted by INM and lamina components. We propose that such molecular interactions are used to compartmentalize and limit the accessibility of Ig loci. Experiment Overall Design: We used microarray to analyze the transcription status of genomic regions are inducibly tethered to the INM</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of mouse epidermis of Tcfap2c mutant and control skin at embryonic day 16.5</name>
      <description>The development of the epidermis, a stratified squamous epithelium, is dependent on the regulated differentiation of keratinocytes. Differentiation begins with the initiation of stratification, a process tightly controlled through proper gene expression. AP-2γ is expressed in skin and previous research suggested a pathway where p63 gene induction results in increased expression of AP-2γ which in turn is responsible for induction of K14. This study uses a conditional gene ablation model to further explore the role of AP-2γ in skin development.  Mice deficient for AP-2γ exhibited delayed expression of p63, K14, and K1, key genes required for development and differentiation of the epidermis. In addition, microarray analysis of E16.5 skin revealed delayed expression of additional late epidermal differentiation genes: filaggrin, repetin and secreted Ly6/Plaur domain containing 1, in mutant mice. The genetic delay in skin development was further confirmed by a functional delay in the formation of an epidermal barrier. These results document an important role for AP-2γ in skin development, and reveal the existence of regulatory factors that can compensate for AP-2γ in its absence. Experiment Overall Design: Skin samples were collected from 3 Tcfap2c and 3 control animals at embryonic day 16.5.</description>

      <name>Transcription profiling of zebrafish larval regenerating fin tissue after exposure to TCDD in order to identify genes differentially regulated after Ahr activation</name>
      <description>Exposures to dioxin, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) cause a wide array of toxicities in vertebrates and is mostly considered to be mediated through the inappropriate activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) signaling pathway. Although transcriptional regulation by Ahr is widely studied, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the adverse outcomes after Ahr activation are largely unknown. To identify the important events downstream of AHR activation that play an actual role in the toxic responses, we employed the zebrafish caudal fin regeneration models since Ahr activation blocks the regenerative process. Zebrafish regenerate their caudal fins by an orchestrated progression of cell migration, differentiation and proliferation controlled by a multitude of signaling pathways. This complex process was exploited as an in vivo platform to identify cross talk between Ahr and other signaling pathways. Global genomic analysis was performed in the larval regenerating fin tissue after exposure to TCDD in order to identify genes differentially regulated after Ahr activation. Comparative toxicogenomic analysis revealed that both adult and larval fins respond to TCDD during regeneration with mis-expression of Wnt signaling pathway members and Wnt target genes. Experiment Overall Design: The caudal fin of zebrafish larvae at 2days post fertilization were amputated and exposed to vehicle control alone or TCDD. Regenerating fins were isolated at 2and 3 days post amputation. Three replicates were collected at each time point. 150 fins were pooled to comprise one replicate.</description>

 Labeling - A total of 100ng of RNA from the larval fin tissue (+/-TCDD) at 2 and 3 dpa were used to generate biotinylated complementary RNA (cRNA) using the Two-Cycle Target Labeling kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).
 Nucleic Acid Extraction - Caudal fins from two day old embryos (AB strain, Eugene, OR) were amputated and the animals were exposed to either DMSO (vehicle control) or 0.5ng/mL TCDD (>99% pure, Chemsyn, Lenexa, KS) in the water for 1 hr (Figure 1). After several rinses in TCDD free water, the larvae were reared until 2 and 3 days post amputation (dpa) when their regenerating fin tissue was amputated and collected for RNA analysis. RNA was extracted from the fin tissue using the RNAqueous Micro kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Three groups at each time point and treatment, each comprised of 150 larval fins, were pooled to make an individual replicate. The quality and quantity of RNA was analyzed by UV absorbance.

      <name>Genome-scale analysis of Staphylococcus aureus reveals host-specific diversification of the core genome.</name>
      <description>Staphylococcus aureus causes disease in humans and a wide array of animals. Of note, S. aureus mastitis of ruminants, including cows, sheep and goats, results in major economic losses worldwide. Extensive variation in genome content exists among S. aureus pathogenic clones. However, the genomic variation among S. aureus strains infecting different animal species has not been well examined. To investigate variation in the genome content of human and ruminant S. aureus we carried out whole genome PCR scanning (WGPS), comparative genomic hybridizations (CGH), and directed DNA sequence analysis of strains of human, bovine, ovine, and caprine origin. Extensive variation in genome content was discovered including host- and ruminant-specific genetic loci. Ovine and caprine strains were genetically allied whereas bovine strains were heterogenous in gene content. As expected, mobile genetic elements such as pathogenicity islands and bacteriophages contributed to the variation in genome content between strains. However, remarkably, most host-specific differences were restricted to regions of the conserved core genome, which contained allelic variation in genes encoding proteins of known and unknown function. Many of these proteins are predicted to be exported and could play a role in host-pathogen interactions. These data suggest that diversification of the core genome may be more important than acquisition of novel genes for S. aureus host-adaptation. The host-specific determinants identified by the whole-genome approaches adopted in the current study represent excellent targets for studies of the evolution and molecular basis of S. aureus host specificity.

      <name>Gene Expression in Fixed Tissues and Outcome in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (Validation Set)</name>
      <description>Background: It is a challenge to identify those patients who, after undergoing potentially curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma, are at greatest risk of recurrence. Such high-risk patients could receive novel interventional measures. An obstacle to the development of genome-based predictors of outcome in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma has been the lack of a means to carry out genomewide expression profiling of fixed, as opposed to frozen, tissues. Methods: We aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of gene-expression profiling of more than 6000 human genes in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. We applied the method to tissues from 307 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, from four series of patients, to discover and validate a gene-expression signature associated with survival. Results: The expression-profiling method for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was highly effective: samples from 90% of the patients yielded data of high quality, including samples that had been archived for more than 24 years. Gene-expression profiles of tumor tissue failed to yield a significant association with survival. In contrast, profiles of the surrounding nontumoral liver tissue were highly correlated with survival in a training set of 82 Japanese patients, and the signature was validated in tissues from an independent group of 225 patients from the United States and Europe (p = 0.04). Conclusions: We have demonstrated the feasibility of genomewide expression profiling of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues and have shown that a reproducible gene-expression signature correlating with survival is present in liver tissue adjacent to the tumor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Keywords: Hepatocellular carcinoma, Expression array, Illumina, Signatures, Outcome prediction Training cohort: 80 tumor and 82 non-tumor liver tissues surgically resected from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); Validation cohort: 225 non-tumor liver tissues surgically resected from patients with HCC.

      <name>Microarray analysis of Gene expression in limb muscles of three mouse models of Kennedy disease/SBMA</name>
      <description>Emerging evidence implicates transcriptional dyseregulation within skeletal muscle in the pathogenesis of Kennedy disease/spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (KD/SBMA). We therefore broadly characterized gene expression in skeletal muscle of three independently generated mouse models of this disorder. The mouse models included a polyglutamine expanded (polyQ) AR knock-in model (AR113Q KI), a polyQ AR transgenic model (AR97Q Tg), and a transgenic mouse which overexpresses wild type AR solely in muscle (HSA-AR Tg). We performed microarray analysis of lower hindlimb muscles taken from these three models using high density oligonucleotide arrays. Changes in gene expression relative to wild type controls were evaluated separately in each strain. We validated our results using quantitative RT-PCR. Patterns of gene expression that are common to all lines and unique to each are described.  When considered globally, the degree of overlap between the three models is approximately equivalent, and several patterns of gene expression relevant to the disease process were observed. Notably, patterns of gene expression typical of loss of AR function were observed in all three models, as were alterations in genes involved in cell adhesion, energy balance, Huntington’s disease, muscle atrophy and myogenesis. By comparing patterns of gene expression in three independent models of KD/SBMA, we have been able to identify candidate genes that might mediate the core myogenic features of KD/SBMA. Keywords: Gene expression in transgenic mice and disease state analysis We used microarray (38.5K oligo mouse array, which contain 35,302 of 70mer oligonucleotide probes largely derived from constitutively expressed exons and 3,482 of controls) to analyze gene expression in limb muscles of transgenic mice. Three mouse models of KD/SBMA were used: HSA-AR, AR113Q knock-in and AR97Q. HSA-AR transgenic male mice (n=5) and their WT brothers (n=8, all mice were 110-130 days of age) were used in this experiment. ARQ113-Knock In males (n=3, 3-4 months of age), and transgenic AR97Q males and WT brothers (n= 6 of each) were used in this study. For both HSA-AR and AR113Q samples, the log2 ratio of experimental samples (Cy5) and reference RNA(Cy3) was obtained, and log2 ratios from mutant samples were then subtracted from log2 ratios from WT controls. AR97Q males (Cy5) were simply compared with their WT brothers (Cy3) using a log2 ratio, rather than being first compared with reference RNA.</description>

 Hybridization - The labelled cDNA was combined with 75 µL of hybridization solution composed of 20:1:1 volume fraction DIG EasyHyb (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Que.), 10 mg yeast tRNA/mL, and 10 mgsalmon sperm DNA/mL. Target cDNAs were denatured at 65 °C (5 min), allowed to cool slightly, and applied to the microarrays. The arrays were sealed in hybridization chambers (Corning) before incubation in a 37 °C water bath for 18 h. Coverslips were removed after submerging the slides in plastic Coplin jars containing 1× SSC/0.1% SDS at 50 °C. The slides were washed (three times for 15 min each) in Coplin jars containing fresh 1× SSC/ 0.1% SDS in a 50 °C water bath, with occasional swirling. Slides were then repeatedly dipped in 1× SSC and then 0.1× SSC, both at room temperature. Liquid was quickly removed from the slide surface by blowing compressed air at a downward angle onto the vertically held slide.
 Labeling - Cyanine (Cy) dyes were directly incorporated into cDNA synthesized from 40 µg of total RNA. RNA was mixed with 1x SuperScript II first-strand buffer (Invitrogen); 10 mmol/L DTT; 150 pmol dT20VN primer; 50 µmol/L dCTP (Amersham Biosciences); 25 µmol/L Cy3- or Cy5-dCTP (Perkin Elmer); and  RNase-free water, up to a volume of 38 µL. The reactions were heated to 65 °C for 5 min, then 42 °C for 5 min, and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (400 U, Invitrogen) was added, and cDNA synthesis was carried out for 3 h at 42 °C.

 Feature Extraction - Data analysis was performed with GeneTraffic Duo 2.5 (Iobion Informatics LLC, La Jolla, Calif.). The data were normalized using the Lowess algorithm at the subgrid level while ignoring flagged values. After normalization of data, average values were taken for statistical analysis. Gene lists were filtered in GeneTraffic to include only those genes that displayed at least 1.4-fold difference and whose coefficient of variance was less than 100% and p-value small than 0.05. Hierarchical cluster analysis and significant analysis of microarrays were performed in GeneTraffic DUO using the Pearson algorithm and average linkage.
 Image Adquisition - Microarrays were scanned at a 10-µm resolution with a ScanArray 4000 system (GSI Lumonics/Perkin Elmer), using both blue and red lasers. The 16-bit TIFF images were saved and pre-processed and quantified with GenePix 5 software (Axon Instruments, Inc., CA). The adaptive quantification algorithm was used.</field>

      <name>Glycogen Accumulation in Chlamydia trachomatis is Controlled by its Plasmid Through Regulation of glgA</name>
      <description>C. trachomatis possess a cryptic 7.5 kb plasmid of unknown function.  Here we describe a comprehensive molecular and biological characterization of the naturally occurring plasmidless human Chlamydia trachomatis strain L2 (25667R).  We found that despite minimal chromosomal polymorphisms the LGV L2 (25667R) strain was indistinguishable from the L2 (434) plasmid positive strain in its in vitro infectivity characteristics such as growth kinetics, plaquing efficiency, and plaque size. The primary in vitro phenotypic differences between L2 (434) and L2 (25667R) were the accumulation of glycogen granules in the inclusion matrix and the lack of the typical intra-inclusion Brownian-like movement characteristic of C. trachomatis strains.  Conversely, we observed a marked difference between the two strains in their ability to colonize and infect the female mouse genital tract. The ID50 of the L2 (25667R) plasmidless strain was 500 fold greater (1.XX x 10X IFU) than the L2 (434) plasmid bearing strain (1. XX x 10X IFU). Transcriptome analysis of the two strains clearly demonstrated a decrease in transcript levels of a subset of chromosomal genes for the L2 (25667R) strain.  Among those genes was glgA which encodes for glycogen synthase; a finding consistent with the failure of the L2 (25667R) strain to accumulate glycogen granules.  Collectively, these findings support an important role for the plasmid in in vivo infectivity and suggest that this virulence characteristic might be controlled by the plasmids ability to regulate the expression of specific chromosomal genes.   These results also support an important role for the plasmid in the pathogenesis of human infection and disease.

      <name>Transcription profiling of mouse PyV-MT treated with conjugated linoleic acid reveals it suppresses FAS and promotes mammary tumorigenesis in mice</name>
      <description>Overexpression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) has been reported in both malignant and premalignant breast lesions, and has been associated with poor outcome. FAS has gained interest as a metabolic target for the treatment of breast cancer based on evidence that blockade with the antifungal antibiotic, cerulenin or synthetic inhibitor C75 inhibits proliferation of breast cancer cells and delays tumor development. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a class of fatty acids found in beef and dairy products, has been shown to inhibit FAS in bovine mammary adipose. Based on previously well-documented anti-tumor activity of CLA, we hypothesized that one mechanism of CLA’s anti-tumorigenic activity may be metabolic blockade of FAS.  We fed virgin PyV-MT transgenic mice a diet supplemented with either 1% CLA, as mixed isomers, or control chow for four weeks. Tissue histology was determined by H&amp;E staining.  cDNA microarray and real-time quantitative PCR were performed to determine relative expression of lipogenic genes. Western blots were used to examine relative protein expression of FAS. Differences in protein densitometry were analyzed using Students 2-sided T-test.  Probability was determined using the binomial sign test. Level of significance for all tests was 0.05. H&amp;E staining revealed a shift towards advanced mammary lesions in the CLA-fed mice compared to control animals (24/26 vs. 11/26) (p for trend &lt; 0.001). Microarray analysis revealed a >2-fold decrease in FAS in the CLA-fed group compared to controls, and was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (p &lt; 0.001) and Western blot. The decrease in FAS mRNA expression was unexpectedly associated with more advanced disease (p for trend &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: Dietary CLA suppressed fatty acid synthase in the mammary glands of the PyV-MT mouse while promoting mammary tumor progression. Experiment Overall Design: PyV-MT and wild type FVB mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bay Harbor, ME) and housed 2–4 per cage in micro insulator rooms. Mice were genotyped according to Jackson Laboratory protocols (http://jaxmice.jax.org/pub-cgi/protocols/protocols). PyV-MT positive females were randomly selected at four weeks of age to receive either a control AIN93G chow (n=5) or 1% CLA-supplemented chow (n=6). . Food disappearance and animal weights were recorded weekly. Animals were palpated three times a week, and tumor area (length x width) was measured by caliper. Only palpable masses with an area >/= 0.5 cm2 were considered established growths. Animals were euthanized by CO2 inhalation. Eight-week-old animals were selected for tissue histology and analysis of mRNA and protein expression. Mammary gland sections were collected and processed to obtain mRNA or protein lysate, paraffin embedded for histology, or stored in liquid nitrogen until further processing.</description>

      <name>Human colon expression in healthy controls and UC</name>
      <description>Activation of inflammatory pathways in human IBD.  Leukocyte recruitment pathways including those for eosiniphils  are activated in the affected colon in IBD. However, the functional implications of this are not known. We hypothesized that pro-inflammatory eotaxin (CCL11) dependent networks would be up regulated in the colon of pediatric patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and that these would regulate eosinophil recruitment to the gut. These experiments tested differential colon gene expression relative to these pathways in healthy and UC samples. Colon biopsy samples were obtained from UC patients at diagnosis, and healthy controls. The global pattern of gene expression was determined using GeneSpring software, and biological networks were identified using Ingenuity software. Data suggested that a leukocyte recruitment network which includeds CCL11 is up regulated in pediatric UC at diagnosis. The degree of up regulation of these genes compared to healthy controls was remarkably conserved within the UC patient group, suggesting common mechanisms of mucosal inflammation. These experiments tested differential colon gene expression relative to these pathways in healthy and UC samples. Keywords: Single time point in UC and healthy controls. Colon RNA was isolated from biopsies obtained from UC at diagnosis and healthy controls. Samples were obtained from the most proximal affected segment of colon. Microarray experiments were performed as described in the CCHMC microarray core, and data was analyzed as described above in the summary. The '107' internal control CEL files (for batches 1,2,4,5) used for ormalization of the Sample VALUEs are also contained within this data set.</description>

      <name>Recurrent 15q13 microdeletions</name>
      <description>We report a recurrent microdeletion syndrome causing mental retardation, epilepsy and variable facial and digital dysmorphisms. We describe nine patients, including six probands; two with de novo deletions, two who inherited the deletion from an affected parent, and two with unknown inheritance. The proximal breakpoint of the largest deletion is contiguous with breakpoint 3 (BP3) of the Prader-Willi/Angelman region extending 3.95 Mb distally to BP5. A smaller 1.5 Mb deletion has proximal breakpoint within the larger deletion (BP4) and shares the same distal BP5. This recurrent 1.5 Mb deletion contains six genes, including a candidate gene for epilepsy (CHRNA7) that is likely responsible for the observed seizure phenotype. The BP4-BP5 region undergoes frequent inversion, suggesting a possible link between this inversion polymorphism and recurrent deletion. The frequency of these microdeletions in mental retardation cases is ~0.3% (6/2082 tested), a prevalence comparable to that of the Williams, Angelman, and Prader-Willi syndromes. Keywords: microdeletion, genomic disorder, mental retardation, epilepsy Patients were intially screened by BAC array CGH (n=290) or qPCR (n=1040). Patients with potential 15q13 deletions were then analyzed on a custom oligonucleotide array targeted to the 15q13 region, results of which are shown here.</description>

      <description>Transcriptome profiling of a L. lactis strain lacking the MDR transporter genes lmrCD and the same strain adapted to cholate was performed. As compared to the parental strain, the cholate-adapted strain showed 124 genes that were significantly differentially expressed more than 1.8-fold . These genes could be grouped into four major functional classes: i.e., genes involved in (i) cell envelope biogenesis;  (ii) stress response and molecular chaperones; (iii) general metabolism and house-keeping function; and (iv) the chromosomally embedded sex-factor. Keywords: Mutant versus wild type comparison, stress response, cholate 1. WT1 L. lactis ΔlmrCD (labeled with Cy3)  2. WT2 L. lactis ΔlmrCD (labeled with Cy5)  3.

      <name>Transcription profiling of striatal samples from 4 CHL2 Q150/Q150 mutant mice and 4 age-matched wild-type mice to investigate the study of huntingtin toxicity and its remedy in model systems.</name>
      <description>Achieving a mechanistic understanding of disease and initiating preclinical therapeutic trials necessitate the study of huntingtin toxicity and its remedy in model systems. To allow the engagement of appropriate experimental paradigms, Huntington’s disease (HD) models need to be validated in terms of how they recapitulate a particular aspect of human disease. In order to examine transcriptome-related effects of mutant huntingtin, we compared striatal mRNA profiles from seven genetic mouse models of disease to that of postmortem human HD caudate using microarray analysis. Transgenic models expressing short N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin (R6/1 and R6/2 mice) exhibited the most rapid effects on gene expression, consistent with previous studies. Although changes in the brains of knock-in models of HD took longer to appear, 15-month and 22-month CHL2Q150/Q150, 18-month HdhQ92/Q92 and 2-year-old YAC128 animals also exhibited significant HD-like mRNA signatures. When the affected genes were compared across models, a robust concordance was observed. Importantly, changes concordant across multiple lines mice were also in excellent agreement with the mRNA changes seen in human HD caudate. Although it was expected that the expression of full-length huntingtin transprotein might result in unique gene expression changes compared to those caused by expression of an N-terminal huntingtin fragment, no discernable differences between full-length and fragment models were detected. There was, however, an overall concordance between transcriptomic signature and disease stage. We thus conclude that the transcriptional changes of HD can be modelled in several available lines of transgenic mice, comprising lines expressing both N-terminal and full-length mutant huntingtin proteins. The combined analysis of mouse and human HD transcriptomes provides an important chronology of mutant huntingtin's gene expression effects. Experiment Overall Design: Striatal samples from 4 CHL2 Q150/Q150 mutant mice and 4 age-matched wild-type mice.</description>
